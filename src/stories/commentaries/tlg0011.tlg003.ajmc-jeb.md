According to Aristotle, the Laconian dogs were crossbred with foxes (ἐξ ἀλώπεκος καὶ κυνὸς οἱ Λακωνικοί, Hist. Anim. 8. 28, p. 607 a ). He describes them as a small breed, with long nostrils and keen scent (ὅσων οἱ μυκτῆρες μακροί, οἶον τῶν Λακωνικῶν κυνιδίων, ὀσφραντικά: Gener. Anim. 5. 2, . 781 b 9). They were the best huntin ogs, as Pindar testifies, fr. 106 : ἀπ Ταὺγέτοιο μὲν Λάκαιναν ιἐπὶ θηρσὶ κύνα τρέφειν [v. l. τρέχειν] πυκινώτατον ἑρπετόν. The Molossian dog is often associated with the Laconian (Hor. Epod. 6. 5 Molossus aut fulvus Laco: Verg. G. 3. 405 Velocis Spartae catulos acremqu Molossum)); but Aristotle tells us that the Molossian breed had no special merit for sporting purposes ; its best product was the large sheep-dog. The chief points common to the Laconian and Molossian breeds were courage and pertinacity (εἰνδρία and φιλοπονία, Arist. Hist. An. 9. 1, . 608 a 31). The use of the feminine gender by Sophocles here may be illustrated by Aristotle's remark,—αι Λάκαιναι κύνες αἱ θήλειαι εὐφυέστεραι τῶν ἀρρένων εἰσίν,i.e., ‘of a finer intelligence ’ (ib. p. 608 a 27)..—Cp. Shakesp. Midsummer-Níht's Dream 4. 1. 124, where Theseus says, My hounds are bned out of the Spartan kind | ..A cry moe tuneable | Was never hola'a' to, nor cheer'd with honn, | In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thhessaly.

is nom., not gen. (from εὔρις). It is true that εὔρις occurs in Aesch. Ag. 1093, and ἄρρινες in Xen. Cyn. 3. 2 ; while εὔρινος (from ῥίς) occurs only in late Greek, as Babrius 43. 8 σκύλαξιν εὐρίνοις: Aelian N. A. 2. 15 δίκην εὐρίνου κυνός, etc. (In Apoll. Rh. 3. 1299 ἑ̔́ρινοι is not from ῥίς, but from ῥινός, —‘of good leather.’) But the form is correct in itself; such alternatives were frequent (cp. σύζυγος by the side of σύλυξ, eetc.. ; and three points here recommend the nominative. (1) The order of the words ὥς τις εὔρινος βάσις. (2) The idiom, consonant with tragic style, by which the epithet of the hound is transferred to βάσιις: cp. Eur. H. F. 450 γραίας ὄσσων .. πηγάς : Phoen. 1351 λευκοπήχεις κτύπους χεροῖν. (3) The fact that βάσις, with no epithet, would be somewhat weak. Libanius (c. 350 A.D.) took (ὔρινος as nom., vol. 4. p. 1065 εὐρίνῳ βάσει τὸ λανθάνον ἀνιχνεύοντες. The genitive was understood by the schol. on v. 7, and by Manuel Palaeologus or. 6. 331 (λάκαιναι κύνες· εὔρινας ταύτας εἶπε Σοφοκλῆς).

Some think tha ἱδρῶτι refers to κάρα only, and that στάζωνν χέρας ξιφοκτόνους s equivalent to στάζωνν αἴματι χέρας : cp. El. 142 φοινία δὲ χεὶρ ? στάζει θυηλῆς Ἄρεο: Aesch. Eum. 41 αἵματι [ στάζοντ χεῖρας. CCertainly ξιφοκτόνους suggestts the blood upon his hands. But the integral phrase, στάζων ι δρῶτι, must surely go with χέρας no less than with κάρα.. The hands are bathed in sweat and in blood.

from meaning ‘to glance timidly’ around, passes into the sense of looking about anxiously for someone or something [(Il. 17. 115](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:17.115) παπταίνων Αἴαντα), and so comes to denote restless search, as in [Pind.

The eneral sense of ἄποπτος here is, ‘far rom my sight; the question is whether this means, () ‘seen only at a distance,’ ‘dimly seen’; or (2) ‘unseen.’ I formerly preferred the first view, for which we may compare [Ph. 467,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006:467,) πλοῦν μὴ Γξ ἀπόπτου μᾶλλον ἢ ’γγύθεν σκοπεῖν, 'to watch the weather near our ship, rather than from afr.’ But I now feel two difficulties which it involves. (1) The emphasis on voice and thought—φθέγμα, φώνημα, ξυναρπάζω φρενί—is so strong as to imply that he doses not see her, even at a distance. (2) There ca ce no doubt that she was visible to the audience. She was probably on the θεολογεῖον,—u sort of platform, which projected from the wings, at the back of the proscenium, and close to its upper edge. If, then, [Odysseus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47231) spoke of her as 'seen only afar,’—a dim vision in the clouds,—the effect would be scarcely happy for the spectators, whose eyees could measure the actual distance between goddess and hero. On the other hand, there would seem nothing strange in her remaining invisible to him. In the [Hippolytus,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q375786) [Aphroditè](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35500) speaks the prologue, and was certainly visible to the spectators; but not to [Hippolytus,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q338201) who says, κλύων μὲν αὐδήν, ὄμμα δ’ οὐχ ὁρῶν τὸ σόν. Whe [Ajax](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) comes forth, he, indeed, appears to see her (v. 91, ὧ χαῖρ’ Ἀθάνα, κ.τ. λ, ; while [to Tecmessa](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10796858) she is invisible (301). But this, again, would not be inconsistent with Greek belief. In [Il. 22. 277](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.277) [Athena](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122) restores the spear to [Achilles,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41746) yet is unseen by [Hector.](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q159666) In [Il. 1. 198](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.198) she appears to [Achilles,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41746) but the others see her not. For ἄποπτος as = ‘out of sight,’ cp. [El. 1488](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg005:1488) (of [Aegisthus)](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q212091) πρόθες [ ἄποπτον ἡμῶν : Dionys. Hal. 2. 54 ἐν ἀπόπτῳ τίθενται τὸν χάρακαα ('in a place out of sight). It may be added that we might suppose [Athena](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122) to be invisible to [Odysseus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47231) nov, without necessarily excluding the idea that she becomes visible to him at a later moment in the dialogue. Thus in [Eur. Hipp. 1391](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg005:1391) the presence of [Artemis](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39503) is known to [Hippolytus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q338201) only by a divine fragrance, though to the spectators she is doubtless visible; but a little later he beholds her (14).)—See Appendix.

The trumet meant here was in form like the oman, —straight, gradually increasin in diameter, and ending in a bell-shap aperture (κώδων). ‘Tyrrhenian,’ a freuent epithet of the trumpet [(Aesch. um. 567,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0085.tlg007:567,) [Eur. Phoem. 1377,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg015:1377,) [Verg. Aen. 8. 526, etc.),](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003:526,etc.),) perhaps means no more than that the instrument was first brought to [Europe](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q46) by Tyrrhenian pirates,—the λῃστοσαλπιγκταί οf Menander (frag. incert. 399). The Tyrrheni, according to a tradition for which [Herodotus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26825) is the earliiest witness (1. 94), were of Lydian origin; and the bronze trumpet may have been a Lydian invention (see Dict. Ant. ‘Tuba). [Homer](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6691) mentions the trumpet only in similes, as when the voice of [Achilles](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41746) is likened to it [(ll. 18. 219, etc.).](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:18.219,etc.).) But the Greeks must have had it as early at least as the time of the Dorian conquest, to judge from the legends heard by [Pausanias](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q192931) at [Argos](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13533353) (2. 21, § 3) where there was a shrine of Ἀθηνᾶ Σάλπιγξ.—See Avvendix. As to the gender of κώδων, [Arist. De Sens. 6 p. 446 22](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg041:6p.44622) has τῆς κώδωνος (bell). In [Ar. Pax 1078](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg005:1078) the words χω κώδων ἀκαλανθίς are said to mean a kind of hound. But κώδων (bell) is masc. with [Thuc.,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41683) [Strabo,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45936) [Plutarch,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41523) [Diodorus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q171241) and Lucian.

The form ἐθελοντής occurs in [Herodotus,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26825) [Thucydides,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41683) [Xenophon,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q129772) and the Orators, as ἐθελοντήρ does in [Od. 2. 292.](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:292.) On the other hand θελοντής is cited only from [Porphyrius](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q203445) (c. 270 A. D., see [Lobeck,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q84734) Phryn. 7) and [Hierocles](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1355265) (c. 450 A.D.), ap. [Stob. Flor. 75. 14 (p. 449. 20).](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2037.tlg001:75.14(p.449.20).) Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by [Plato (Crat. 406 A),](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg005:406A),) while the earliest authority for θελήμων is Apoll. Rhod. 2. 557. In tragic iambics θέλω was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to ἐθέλω, though the latter occurs in tragic anapaests (as [O. T. 1303,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg004:1303,) [Ph. 145).](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006:145).) If θελοντής were found in a passage where metre requiredit, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection. But where, as here, aphaeresis was available, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote

Rhet. 2. 8. 4,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038:2.8.4,) where οἱ πεπαιδευμένοι are called εὐλόγιστοι, i.e., ‘rellecting,’ ‘prudent.’ In its passive sense, δυσλόγιστον would mean that the deed is ‘inexplicable’: cp. [Anaximenes](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q221787) ap. [Stob.. Eclog. 2. 8. 17](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2037.tlg001:2.8.17) τὸ γὰρ δυσλόγιστον τοῦ βίου τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τύχην προσαγορεύομεν, ‘we give the name of chance to that element in life which men find hard to explain.’ But here the agent's frenzy is more in point than the observer's perplexitm.—Some take δυσλόνιστον with τί: ‘for what unintelligible reason?’ But this enfebles the sense and mars the rhythm.

the tentdoors of the two chiefs, [Agamemnon](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q128176) and [Menelaaus.](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q171839) (Cp. Paus. 4. 19. 2 τὴν σκηνὴν τὴν στρατηγίδα.) The phrase is equivalent, of course, to δισσῶν στρατηγῶν πύλαι. 721 στατήγιον, n. But, since there were two tents and two entrances, δισσαῖς is strictly the epithet of πύλαις: i.e., the literal sense is, ‘two doors of chiefs.’ If the two chiefs had shared the same tent, so that only one entrance could be meant by πύλαις, then, indeed, δισσαῖς could be explained only as referring to the subst. implied in στρατηγίσιν,— ‘the tent-door of two chiefs,’ y δισσοστρατηγίσιν πύλαις. But such a use of δισσαῖς seems impossible. Could δισσὰ ἀδελφῶν ἅρματα (e.g.) mean, ‘a chariot belonging to two brothers'?

Some editors strangely prefer the conjecture λήμας, —as if the goddess had afflicted him with sore or weak eyes [(Ar.

For the adj., cp. [El. 888](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg005:888) θάλπει τῷδ’ ἀνηκέστῳ πυρί (n.8. Others take the gen. as depending on ἀπείργω, placing a comma after the verb, and another after βαλοῦσα,——a punctuation which is found in the Aldine. But (1) the sense of χαρᾶς is then attenuated to that of ‘hoped-for vengeance,’—whereas, as ἀνηκέστου shows, it clearly denotes the frantic joy which [Ajax](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) actually felt; and (2) the order of words is then less natural.

These three verses have been rejected (cr. n.), on the ground that, after this promise from [Athena,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122) [Odysseus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47231) had no cause to feel the alarm which he shows in p 4.74 ff., or to ask the question (v. 84) which elicits a renewal of that promise (85). But the poet wished to render the preparation for the hero’s entrance as impressive as possible; and chose, therefore, to represent [Odysseus—a](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47231) brave man—as still uneasy, until the assurance given to him had been reeated in a yet more explicit and emphatic form.

[Odysseus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47231) refrains from replying that [Ajax](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) was then sane, but now is frenzied. 'Yes,’ he answers, ‘my foeman,—as he is still.’ That enmity, he means, will nov be more dangerous than ever.

When a proper name of the 3rd declension comes from a stem ending in αντ (as ἰαντ), the Attic vocative ends in ᾶς: so Θόας, ἄκουσον, [Eur. I. T. 1436.](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg013:1436.) The Homeric vocative of ἴας is always Αἶαν (ᾰ), —formed on the analogy of te voc. from stems in οντ, as Κρέον (stem Κρεοντ). The vocatives Ποουλυδάμα (Il. 12. 231), Λαοδάμα (Od. 8. 1441) are exceptions, due perhaps to a sense that here the ending -αν might suggest an accusative.

It comes from ἐνίστασθαι as = 'to stand in the way’ of a person or thing, ‘oppose,’ ‘resist.’ For the literal sense, see Lysias or. 3 5 8 εὐθύς με τύπτειν ἐπεχείρησεν· ἐπειδὴ δὲ αὐτὸν ἠμυνάμην ἐστάν (‘when I stood up to hin and repelled him ), ἔβαλλέ με λίθοις: for the fig. sense, Thuc. 8. 69 § 2 ἦν τις ἐνιστῆται τοῖς ποιουμένοις. Hence in logic, ἔνστασις, instantia, ‘objection’ (cp. Isocr. or. 5 § 39, ἐνστῆναι τοῖς εἰρημένοις). In Etym. M. p. 625. 25 ἐνστάτης (quoted from this passage) is loosely explained. as = ἀντιστάτης.

not πρὸς κίονι, was thus the usual phrase; but Artemidorus (c. 160 A.D.) Oneirocr. 1. 78 has προσδεθεὶς κίονι ἔλαβε πληγὰς πολλάς. Cp. 240.—κίων is masc. in Attic. Herodotus uses it in both genders (fem. 1. 94, masc. 4. 184). With Pindar it is always fem.; and usually so in the Odyssey, but not always; in Od. 8. 66, πρὸς κίονα μακρὸν ἐρείσας, the masc. has a metrical motive, but not in 19. 38, κίονες ὑψόσʼ ἔχοντες.

After θανεῖν γὰρ αὐτὸν οὔ τί πω θέλω (106), we should have had πρὶν ἄν φοινιχθῇ. But the emphasis on μάστιγι πρῶτον νῶτα φοινιχθεὶς serves to excuse the presence of θάνῃ,—added, for the sake of greater clearness, after the long interval. So in Tr. 1130 Hyllus says of Deianeira, τέθνηκεν, and then in 1133 Heracles, οἴμοι· πρὶν ὡς χρῆν σφʼ ἐξ ἐμῆσ θανεῖν χερός; where the stress on τῆς ἐμῆς similarly palliates the illogical form of the sen-

It seems best to suppose that the constr. is ἐφίεμαι χαίρειν σε, 'It is my injunction that thou have thy wil in all else.’ Cp. O. T. 1054 f. ὅντινʼ ἀρτίως| μολεῖν ἐφλμέμεσθα: where the acc. similarly belongs to the inf. There is no example of ἐφίεμαί τινα (instead of τινι) ποιεῖν τι; though we find in Tr. 1221 τοσοῦτον δή σʼ ἐσισκήπτω, like κελεύω τινά τι. Nor does the sense here require that σε should be the object of ἐφίεμαι.—Remark the objection to rendering ἐφίεμαι here 'I desire': when the verb has that sense, with an inf., its subject is the same as that of the inf.: e.g. Phil. 1315 ὧν δέ σου τυχεῖν ἐφέεμαι, ἄκουσον. Further, the sense, 'enjoin,' 'command,' better suits the insane ὕβρις

Parodos, in two main parts, vi., (1) 134—171, the anapaestic marching-song, or parodos proper, sung by the Chorus asthey enter ; (2) 172200, the lyric ode, sung after they have taken up their position in the orchestra. This is the form of Parodos used by Aeschylus in the Persae, the Supplices, and the Agamemnon.. Nearest to this early and simple form is that in which lyric strophes are intermingled with anapaestic systems. A parodos of the latter type is found in the Prometheus Vinctus, the Antigone, and the Philoctetes. The anapaestic march consists here of 38 verses; in the Aeschylean Supplices, of 40. It is much longer in the Fersae (64 v.), and in the Agamemnon (63). The Chorus of fifteen Salaminian sailors enter the orchestra from the spectator’s right (as they come from their quarters in the Greek camp). They march in three files (στοῖχοι) of five men each. At the close of the anapaests (v. 171), they form themselves in three ranks (ζυγά) of five each, facing the proscenium. It can scarcely be doubted that the anapaests were chanted by the whole Chorus, and not by the coryphaeus alone (see A. Malller, Gr. Bïhnenaterthümer, p. 217, n. 2).

The followers of Ajax call upon him to come forth from his tent, —where, for some days previously, he had remained in sullen secluson (194f), —and to refute this dire rumour of his onslaught on the cattle. Surely it is a malignant slander. Or is it possible that some angry deity has driven him to such a deed? Assuredly it is abhorrent from his own nature.

would, as it were, turn his eyes seaward, inviting him to look forth from the shore of Salamis itself towards the Saronic Gulf. Each adjective lends a touch to the picture. This is thoroughly Greek. See, ſor instance, Eur. I. Α. 164 ἔμολον ἀμφὶ παρακτίαν ψάμαθον Αὐλίδος ἐναλίας, the sandy sea-shore of Aulis bν the waves: Helen. 400 ἐπ’ οἶδμα πόντιον γλαυκῆς ἁλός,—where the blue expanse, the surge, and the depths beneath it (πόντιον) ane all suggested. ἀγχίαλος was properly said of a place on the sea-caast (Il. 2. 640 Χαλκίδ τ’ ἀγχίαλον). Inn Aesch. Pers. 888 it is a mere general epithet for islands (Lenos, Icaros, etc.). Here, in the Athenian oet's mind, it has its proper sense, for e is thinking of Salamis as a fringe of the Attic coast; and it is again the Athenian's point of view which interprets the true relaition of ἀγχιάλου to ἀμφιρύτου. ἔωχων: cp. Pind. N. 4. 48 Αίαν Σαλαμῖν’ ἔχει πατρῴαν.

the plain ‘wild with horses,’ i.e., on which great numbers of horses (out at pasture) disport themselves. In Il. 20. 22I Erichthonius, son of Dardanus, is described as keeping great droves of horses on the moist meadow-lands near the lower spurs of Ida : τοῦ τρισχίλιαι ἵπποι ἕλος κάτα βουκολέοντο. Sophocles used the word καρπομανής (fr. 601), doubtless in a sense parallel with that o ὑομανής, i. . labounding in fruit’: and the sense which he attached to λειμὼν ἱππομανής was probably λειμὼν ὃς μαίεται ἵπποις rather than ἐν ᾧ ἴπποι μαίνονταιι. But the idea of wild abundance would naturally, in this case, be blended with that of the horses frisking or galloping in freedom on the plain. Hence the difference made by the verbal analysis which we prefer is not one which much affects the picture. —See Appendix.

L. has πάντων ὀδυσσεύς, and it is possible that (as Nauck thinks) the poet wrote πάντων Ὀδυσεύς. (Euripides has that Homeric form in anapaests, Hec. 143 ἥξει δ’ Ὀδυσεὺς ὅσον οὐκ ἥδη.) Bu it seems improbable, seeing that the short form occurs nowhere else in Sophocles, though he uses the name some twenty-five times. On the other hand, a transcriber might easily have written the gen. πάντων after ὧτα, by mistake for the less usual dative.

= Ταυροπόλος: for the form, cp. Pind. O. 3. 26 Λατοῦς ἱπποσόα θυγάτηρ: Eur. Ion 1478 Γοργοφόνα. There were two cults of Artemis, originally quite distinct. (1) The Ταυροπόλος was a goddess who rules over bulls,—one of the numerous attributes of Artemis in her relation to wild animals: cp. αἰπόλος, ιπποπόλος, οἰοπόλος. A Macedonian silver coin (from Amphipolis) shows her riding on a prancing bull, and carrying a torc in either hand. On another coin she appears (with the inscr. ΤΑΥΡΟΠΟΟΣ) carrying two torches, and with the horns off a bull growing out of her shoulders : these horns were meant to suggest the crescent moon. The cult of the Taurolos was purely Greek, and had nothing erce or cruel about it. (2) The cult of Artemis Ταυρική (or Ταυρώ) had orgiastic elements; it was of Asiatic origin, and belonged to a primitive stage of natureworship. The ritual was a bloody one, and in early times involved human sacrifice. This was the Artemis whose cult was said to have been brought to Brauron in Attica, from the Tauric Chersonese, by Iphigeneia and Orestes. It is possible that Sophocles here was thinking only of the Ταυροπόλος proper, and names her simply because bulls had been among the victims of Ajax. On the other hand, the savage nature of the bloody onslaught might suggest that she was associated in his thought with the Ταυρική. Such an association occurs as early as Eur. I. T. 1457 where the Brauronian Artemis (ἐπώνυμον γῇ Ταυρικῆς, 12454) is called Ταυροπόλος. The dithyrambic poet Timotheus of Miletus (c. 400 B.c.) addressed the Ephesian Artemis as μαινάδα, θυιάδα, φοιβάδα, λυσσάδα (Bergk fr. 1). See Appendix.

Artemis the huntress (Ἀγροτέρα) was especially Ἐλαφηβόλος: see on O. C. 1092 f, and cp. Tr. 213 Ἀρτεμιν ΟὈρτυγίαν ἐλαφαβόλον.

2he reading of the Mss., ἢ χαλκοθώραξ ἤ τιν’ Ἐνυάλιος, was explained by supposing that χαλκοθώραξ meant Ares, as distinguished from Enyalios (so the schol. here)). How the second should be corrected, is uncertain. (1) n favour of μή, it may be noted that the interrogative μή is oſten followed, ashere, by τις, and that its tone of tentative suggestion is just in place. Cp. Od. 9. 405 f. ἧ μή τίς σεο μῆλα βροτῶν ἀέκοντος ἐλαύνει: | ἧ μή τίς σ’ αὐτὸν κτείνει δόλῳ ἠὲ βίηφι; O. C. 1502 μή τις Διὸς κεραυνός, ἤ τις ὀμβρία | χάλαζ’ ἐπιρράξασα; (2) Another ossibility is δη η, as ='then’ (to make a ast guess). (3) σοί would be fitting, indeed, but would require us to suppose that the second ἤ in the Ms. is an inadvertent repetition of the first, not a corruption of some word like itself. (4) εἴ has also been suggested. But the implied construction, μομφὰν ἔχων, εἴ τιν' (εἶχεν), would be too hars. (5) ἦ is condemned by the fact that with Sophocles this interrogatve ἦ regularly stands first in its clause ; only a vocative sometimes precedes it : see on Ant. 1281.

is in the Iliad either the War-god (2. 651), seemingly identical with Ares, or an epithet of Ares (17. 211 Ἄρης | δεινὸς ἐνυάλιος Like Ἐνυώ, the word is of uncertain (possibly Thracian) origin. The mention of this deity has a two-fold fitness here ; (1) on account of the reference in 178 to Artemis Agrotera ; for, acc. to Pollux 8. 91, the Athenian Polemarch made annual offerings ‘Ἀρτέμιδι’ Ἀγροτέρᾳ καὶ τῷ Ἐνυαλίῳ : (2) because in the island-home of Ajax there was a ιερόν of Enyalios, founded by Solon to commemorate the victory by which Athens wrested Salamis from the Me. garians (Plut. Sol. 9).. Further, Enyalios is here supposed to have helped Ajax; whereas Ares usually favoured the Trojans (cp. Il. 20. 38). As to the Attic relationship between the two deities, see Appendix.

helps to suggest the idea of “hidden.’ The objections to the version, “keeping thine eyes fixed on the tents, are, (1) that ἔχων could not well stand for ἐπέχων, and (2) that the seclusion of Ajax within his tent is not then expressed.— ἄρρη with (=λώβαν in 181), from cp. 129, and see Appendix on 75. 1f. ἄνα, the prep, with anastrophe, as = ἀνάστηθι: the hiatus as i Jl. 9. 247 ἀλλ' ἄνα, εἰ μέμονάς γε.—ὅπου .. ποτέ, ‘wheresoever,’ i.e. in whatever spot within the dwelling. The change of ποτὲ to ποτὶ (on which see Tr. 1214 n. introduces a strange phrase, στηρίζει πρὸς σχολῇ. The simple dat. (of circumstance) is clearly right. ἀγωνιῳ σχολᾷ seems to mean, ‘battlepause,’ i.., rest from battle. Other explanations are : (1) σχολή which causes an ἀγών (discrimen); because, while Ajax rests, his foes are perilously active. Now, if the Chorus assumed that Ajax, while absent from battle, had been employed in other effort, then, indeed, they might call his rest ἀγώνιος σχολή, ‘a strenuous rest,’ like otium neyotiosum. But it seems impossible that dἀγώνιος σχολή should mean merely, his ‘perilous’ or ‘critical’ rest,—made so by the acts of others. 15 ἄταν οὐρανίαν φλέγων, ‘kindling a flame of ruin high as heaven,’ Whitelaw. Cp. Aesch. Suppl. 898 ίϋζε δ ὀμφὰν οὐρανίαν = oοὐρανομήκη: and see n. on Ant. 418. This is more forcible here than, ‘inflaming the heaven-sent plague’ (= θείαν: cp. 186. 0f. ἀτάρβητα, neut. pl. as adverb. I keep this, the reading of the MSS., as Wecklein and Bellermann do. Dindorf strikes out ὧδ’ (unwarrantably), and writes ἀτάρβητος. In an epode, the strophic test is absent, and the logaoedic metre admits of Dindorf's reading. There is, however, a point in favour of ἀτάρητα which deserves to be noted; viz., that the adverbial neut. pl., though it has no special relation to verbs of motion, is, in fact, very often joined with such verbs; and that the phrase ἀτάρβητα ὁρμᾶται is therefore thoroughly consonant with poetical usage. See (.g.) O. T. 883 ὑπέροπτα πορεύεται: 0. C. 1695 οὔτοι κατάμεμπτ' ἔβητον : l. 17. 75 ἀκίχητα διώκωων | ́ππους: Pind. O. 7. 45 βαίνει...ἀτέκμαρτα: Eur. Ph. 1740 ἀπαρθένευτ' ἀλωμένα: Bacch. 435 οὐδ’ ἄκκρανθ' ὡρμήσαμεν. For the hiatus at the end of the verse, cp. 425 χθονὸς μολόντ’ ἀπὸ ]'Ἑλλανίδος. εὐανέμοις, with α (not a, as if Doric for εὐηνέμοις): so probably in fr. 342 εὐανέμου λίμνας. Cp. Od. 19. 432 πτύχας ἠνεμοέσσας.—βάσσσαις: O. C. 6673 χλωραῖς ὑπὸ βάσσαις (n.ς Il. 2 1. 49 Ἴδης ἐν κνημοῖσι πολυπτύχου ὑληέσσης. 8f. καγχαζόντων. Dindorf writes καχαζόντων, on the ground that the form καγχάζω was not Attic. (His further change of πάντων into ἁπάντων is merel for the sake of equalising this v. wit 197 f) The main facts are these. I. Aristophanes uses καχάζων once 2Eccl. 849), and also the noun καχασμῶν (Nub. 1073)). 2. It is true that καγχάζω cannot be proved by metre from any verse earlier than that of Babrius (100. 8 καγχάσας), and Paulus Silentiarius (6th cent.) in Anth. Pal. 6. 74. 3 (καγχάζουσα). 3. On the other hand the Mss. have ανεκάγχασε in Plat. Rep. 337 A, and ἀνακαγχάσας in Euthyd. 300 D; forms, be it noted, which carry their own commendation, since, in the compound with ἀνά, the nasal (y before χ) makes pronunciation easier. 4. Lastly, there is the analogy of the Homeric καγχαλάω. Surely, then, there is no reason to doubt that Sophocles could have used καγχάζω if he found it metrically convenient. γητα. I follow the MS. in leaving the hiatus (cp. 196), which here has the special justification of a pause, making it needless to write βαρυαλγήτως with Dindorf. That the scholiast in , like the MSss., had the neut. pl., appears from his paraphrase, βαρέα καὶ ἀλγεινά. Some editors preſer to write βαρυάλγητ', which is also metrically possible. The sense is, Jfraught with heavy pain’ to us; the ἄλγος is not the bitter indignation felt by the Greeks. The word occurs only here : and βαρυαλγής is post-classical. —ἔστακεν, ‘stands fixed’: cp. 1084. 201—505 2he first ἐπεισόδιον fallls into two principal parts. In the first (201-3322), the hero’s plight is made clear by the exchange of tidings between Tecmessa and the Chorus, each learnin what the other has to tell. In the secon part (33— 595), Ajax himself speaks with the Chorus and Tecmessa; his words foreshadow a resolve to die. The first rt opens with a kommos between the horus and Tecmessa (2201—262); the second, with a kommos between the Chorus and Ajax (348-429). 201 ναὸς ἀρωγοὶ, i.e. rendering service in it; Ajax addresses them as γένος ναὶ́ας ἀρωγὸν τέχναν (356). The Iliad (2. 557) assigns twelve ships to Ajax. 202 γενεᾶς: for the ge., cp. Plat. Prot. 3166 B Ἀπολλοδώρου υἱός, οἰκίας μεγάλης.—χθονίων ἀπ’ Ἐρεχθειδᾶν: for ἀπὸ with ref, o, cescenc, cp. Ant. 193 παίδων τῶν ἀπ’ Οἰδίπου. Erechtheus, ὁ γγενής (Her. 8. 55), ‘whom Earth, the grain-giver, brought forth, and Athena, daughter of Zeus, fostered’ (Il. 2. 547), is representative of the Athenian claim to be αὐτόχθονες. It was in his reign, acc. to Her. 8. 44, that the folk once callled Κραναοί, and then Κεκροπίδαι, were first named Δεθηναῖοι. For Ἐρεεχθεῖδαι aσ =Ἀθηναῖοι, cp. Pind. I. 2. 19 κλειναῖς Ἐρεχθειδᾶν χαρίτεσσιν ἀραρὼς . ταῖς λιπαραῖς ἐν Ἀθάναις, ‘having attained to the glorious honours given by the Erechtheidae in shining Athena.’’ (In Ant. 9881 f., however, the patronymic has a narrower sense, denoting merely the family of Erechtheus.) So, again, the Athenians are Θησεῖδαι (O. C. 1066), the Thebans Καδμεῖοι, the Trojans or Romans Aeneadae; and an unknown poet (frag. adesp. 274) calls the Argives χθονίο͂ς [ναχίδας, where Hesychius explains the adj. by αὐτόχθονας καὶ οὐκ ἐπήλυδας, the sense of χθονίων here. (Cp. O. C. 948 n.) Salamis is in this play a kingdom independent of Athens, but the Salaminians are of Athenian stock, and revere ‘sacred Athens’ (122) as the metropolis of their race. See Introduction, § 4. 204 τηλόθεν instead of τηλοῦ : cp. Tr. 315 γέννημα τῶν ἐκεῖθεν (n.). It goes with τοῦ. .. οἴκου, not with κηδόμενοι 208 ὠμοκρατὴς denotes the rugged, massive, untamed strength of Ajax, and is meant to suggest a contrast with his resent affition; so 548 ὠμοῖς .. νόμοις, 85 ὠμόθυμος, 931 ὠμόφρων. (The word was absurdly taken by some to mean, ‘with strong shoulders,’—as the lliad mentions his εὐρέας ὥμους, 3. 227.) 206f. θολερῷ (θολός, ὁ, mud), ‘turbid, with ref. to his clouded mind : cp. Her. 4. 53 (of a river) ῥέει τε καθαρὸς παρὰ θολεροῖσι. So Aesch. P. V. 885 θολεροὶ δὲ λόγοι παίουσ’ εἰκῇ | στυγνῆς πρὸς κύμασιν ἄτης, —words turbid with passion..— χειμῶνι: cp. Ph. 1194 ἀλύοντα χειμερίῳΙ λύπᾳ: i'. 1460 χειμαζομένῳ..—νοσήσας, ‘stricken’: this aor., in the ‘ingressive sense (‘fell ill'), is frequent in Attc: e.gg. Thuc. I. 138 § 4 νοσήσας τελευτᾷ τὸν βίον : Plat. Tim. p. 84 c ὅταν...νοσήσῃ. 208 f. τί δὲ βάρος ἐνήλλακται νὺ ἥδε τῆς ἡμερίας; ‘And what heaviness (heavy trouble) has the past night received in exchange for the (already grievous) fortune of the day?’ ἐνήλλακται in a midd. sense; cp. Diod. frag. 60 ἐγένετο βασίλισσα ἰδιωτικκῆς ἐστίας ἐξηλλαγμένη ἡγεμονίαν. The fact that ἥλλαγμαι has more often a passive sense in Attic is quite compatible with such an exceptional use ; thus Antiphon can say, τὸν πλοῦν πεποιημένος (or. 5 § 21), and τετιμωρημένος ἑαυτόν (Tetr.. Β. β. 8 8). But it is more doubtful whether such a notion as μοίρας, πράξεως, r καταστάσεως can here be supplied with τῆς ἡμερίας. The parallels adduced are such as ἡ ἑῷα, ἡ ἑωθινή, ἣ ὀψία, ἡ πρωἶα, τὴν θερείην (in summer,’ Her. l. 189), τὴν χειμερινήν (id. 1. 202). There was indeed a tendency in Greek idiom to make substantive out of fem. adjectives; i.e. to use the fem. adj. alone, whenever the subst. (such as γῆ, ὁδός, ὥρα, μοῖρα, δίκη) could readily be under— stood. And that tendency must be considered here. No tolerable emendation has been made. ἠρεμίας, ‘stillness,’ though possible, is very feeble. εὐμαρίας (2ηὑμαρείαες), which Nauck adopt, is directly contrary to the sense; for, even before the dread rumour arose, the Chorus had been disquieted by the long seclusion and inaction of Ajax (194 f). ἀμμορίας, without some further definition (such as τῆς πρῖν), would be too vague. And the words νῦξ ἤδε suggest that there was some mention of day. On the whole, the traditional reading, though difficult, is less open to objection than any remedy which has been proposed. The schol. in L has: γρ. δὲ ἀημερίας ἀντὶ τῆς ἀηδοῦς φορᾶς ('unpleasant course ), καὶ ἔσται ὁ νοῦς, ποῖον βάρος ἕλαβεν αὔτη ἡ νῦ ἀπὸ τῆς προτέρας ἀ ηδίας; This explanation of ἀημερίας by ἀἰοδοῦς φορᾶς and ἀηδίας indicates (I think) a reference, not to ἡμέρα—as if ἀημερία could mean δυσημερία——but to ἥμερος : the original scholium may have had ἀνημερίας (meant as ‘unkindly fortunee). 210 Φρυγίου Ταλεύταντος. Cp. 331 : 488. Similar examples confirm this reading: fr. 796 Ἀλφεσίβοιαν ἢν ὁ γεννήσας πατήρ (it is improbable that Sophocles wrote Αλφησίβοιαν): Aesch. Th. 488 Ἱππομέδοντος σχῆμα: Eur. Suppl. 889 Παρθενοπαῖος, εἶδος ἐξοχώτατος. (Aesch. Th. 547, Πααρθενοπαῖος Ἀρκάς, is rejected by many critices.) Indeed, such license was not strictly confined to proper names, to judge by Aesch. Ch. 10449 φαιο͂χίτωνες. Lobeck remarks that the father of Tecmessa is called Teuthras by Malela and others, Tethras by Cedrenus, and Tuthas by Tzetzes. 211 1. λέχος, concubine, ὁμευνέτις (501): being δουριάλωτος, she is δούλη (489).. Cp. Tr. 36ο κρύφιον ὡς ἔχοι λέχος (Iole),.,σε.. στέρξας ἀνέχει: lit., “having conceived a love for thee, he upholds thee,’-i.e., ‘he is constant in his affection for thee’: so Eur. Hec. 123 βάκχης ἀνέχων λέκτρ' Ἀγαμέμνων,‘constant to’ her bed. (In O. C. 674, where τὸν οἰνῶπ’ ἀνέχουσα κισσὸν is the common reading, we should probably read τὸν οἰνωπὸν ἔγουσα κισσόν. 218 ὑπείποις, ‘hint,’ 'give a clue’: they do not yet surmise, from her words in 205—207, with what terrible fulness of detail she can speak. 214 i. λέγω, subjunct.—θανάτῳ. . ἴσοςν O. C. 529 θάνατος μὲν τάδ’ ἀκούειν. In the Creusa, fr. 332, Sophocles used ἰσοθάνατον as = οὐ πάνυ ἀνεκτόν, acc. to Pollux 6. 174. 21f. μανίᾳ γὰρ: notice the γάρ in two successive clauses (El. 180 n.): here it prefaces the statement (O. T. 277 n.).— ἡμῖν, ethic dat: Ε El. 272.—νύκτερος, adverbial: cp. 930 πάννυχα καὶ φαέθοντ' ἀνεστέναζες. 4l. 1. 497 ἠερίη δ’ ἀνέβη. The word is irregularly placed, as if the speaker had meant to designate Ajax by ὁ κλεινὸς only, and had then added AΑἴας for similar irregularities, cp. El. 693 f., n. —ἀπελωβήθη, a sonewhat rare pass. aor.: Ph. 30 ἐξελωβήθη: Plat. Gorg. 473 c λώβας ..λωβηθείς. 218 X. τοιαῦτ’, introducing the ground for the statement; cp. 164 n.— αἱμοβαφῆ : cp. 95 ἔβαψας ἔγχος εὖ..;— χρηστήρια, with tragic pathos, since the word denoted holy sacrifices to the gods (properly, before consulting an oracle) : Aesch. Theb. 230 σφάγια καὶ χρηστήρια θεοῖσιν ἔρδειν. Cp. Ag. 645 παιᾶνα τόνδ Ἑρινύων. 221—282 A strophe, to which vv. 245—256 form the antistrophe. For the metres, see Metrical Analysis. 221 A. ἀνέρος . ἀγγελίαν: for the objective gen., cp. 998: Ant. 11 μῦθος.. φίλων (n..—αἴθονς, ‘fiery’; cp. 1088 : Aesch. Theb. 448 aαἴθων ..λῆμα: in v. 147 the word is applied to a bright sword. This infſexion (instead of αἴθων) occurs elsewhere only in Hes. Op. 361 αἴθονα λιμόν (Bergk’s correction of the Ms. αἴθοπα), a reading which is made certain by Aeschin. or. 3 § 184 λιμόν τ’ αἴθωνα κρατερόν τ’ ἐπάγοντες Ἄρηα, and Callim. Jymn. Cer. 68 ἔμθαλε λιμόν, αἴθωνα, κρατερόν: where the fig. sense of the epithet is 'fiercc.’ The v.l. αἴθοπος is impossible here, as in the verse of Hesiod; it could refer only to complexion. Cp. Eustathius p. 862. 10 φέρεται αἴθων βοῦς καὶ σίδηρος καὶ ἄνθρωπος καὶ λέων· αἴθοψ δὲ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν λέγοιτ’ ἄν, ἀλλὰ τοὔνομα οἴνῳ μέλανι ἐπιτίθεται.. The variant was doubtless due, in both passages, to the rarity, for αἴθων, of the inflexion with oο; which is illustrated by the dat. pl. νήφοσι in Theognis 481, and by such alternative forms of the gen. as Αἴσονος, Ἀκταίονος, etc. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν, unendurable, and yet one from which there is no escape: for οὐο as= ἀλλ' οὐ, cp. El. 132, 1034 228 τῶν μεγάλων Δαναῶν are clearl not the Greek chiefs (οι μεγάλοι βασιλῆς, 189), but the Greek army at large. It is the popular fury that the Salaminians are now thinking of: in 228 περίφαντος.θανεῖται alludes to public stoning, the λιθόλευστον Ἀρη of v. 253.—κλήεομέναν, noised abroad by them: cp. Tr. 659 κλῄζεται θυτήρ, he is rumooured to sacrificing ; and ib. 1268 κληζόμενοι | πατέρες· 226 ὁ μέγας μῦθος: cp. 173 σῆ μεγάλα φάτις (n.).—ἀέξει, αύξει, increases by diffusing it. (Not, ‘exaggerates.’) 228 περίφαντος: cp. 1311 θανεῖν προδήλως. 229 B. παραπλάκτῳ, frantic: Eur. H. F. 935 γέλωτι παραπεπληγμένῳ. The adj. is more usually παραπλήξ. Cp. 40 δυσλόγιστον. . χέρα..—συγκατακτὰς, slain in a confused heap, cattle and men together. (In Eur. Or. 1089 συγκατέκτανον =‘helped to slay.’) For the nonthematic aor., cp. Tr. 38 ἔκτα (n.).— κελαινοῖς here suggests both the dark, leaming metal, and the dark stains of lood upon it. Cp. Tr. 856 κελαινὰ λόγχα (n..—ξίφεσιν, poet. plur.: cp. Pind. P. 4. 242 Φρίξου μάχαιραι: Eur. Ion 192 ἅρπαις (the scimitar of Perseus). The dat. ξίφεσιν, following χερί, defines the instrument used (slain by the hand with the sword): cp. 310 ὄνυξι συλλαβὼν χερί. Eur. Helen. 373 ὄνυχι..γένυν | ἔδευσε φοινίαισι πλλαγαῖς. ιππονώμας, ‘guiding horses,’ refers to riding in both th other places where it occurs (Eur. Hipp. 1399, of Hippolytus ; Ar. Nul. 571, of Poseidon Hippius). Here, βοτῆρας, closely following βοτά, must mean the herdsmen who tended the sheep and oxen (= ποιμνίων ἐπιστάταις, 27). It would be forced, then, to suppose that ἰππονώμας means ‘tending horses,r-with ref. to the horses of the Greeks on the λειμὼν ἱππομανής (143 f.).. That would be as if one said, ‘the cattle, and their herdsmen, who also tended horses.’ Herdsmen in charge of great flocks and herds, on a wide plain, and near a watchful foe, might well be mounted. It is no objectionand least of all, in an Attic tragedythat the Homeric warrior does not ride. —The reading ἱππονώμας, instead of ιππονόμους (’horse-feeding’), is made certain by metre (v. 245), and is confirmed by the first hand in L (cr. n.). 288 f. ἄρα, ‘then,’ marks her new perception: cp. 927, 934, 1026: Tr. 1172, etc.—ἤλυθε. This form, not used by Aesch., occurs only here in Soph.; Eur. has it not only in lyrics (Or. 813, etc., but also in dialogue (El. 598, Tro. 374). 285 f. ὧν (neut.), instead of ἧς, since ποίμνην is a ‘noun of multitude’cp. O. C. 1070 ἄμβασις, οἳ κ τ.λ. (n.). Then τὴν μὲν (sb.. ποίμνην) follows ὧν, as it might have followed ἦς: cp. Thuc. 1. 2 8 3 τῆς γῆς ἡ ἀρίστη, ib. 5 § 1 τὸν πλεῖστον τοῦ βίου. Finaly, τὰ δε (. βοτὰ reters to o͂ν.—The antithesis to τὴν μὲν is given by τὰ δέ, not (as some have thought) by δύο δ.-ἔσω, “within the house,’ refers to all the incidents that followed his arrival (ἤλυθε)). Schneidewin wrongly joins ἔσω ζε (Astach tot’), comparing Aesch. Ag. 1343 πέπληγμαι καιρίαν πληγὴν ἔσω. But σφάζε denotes ‘cuting the throat, not 'stabbing’; cp. 298.—ἐπὶ γαίας, where they stood upon the floor; as distinguished from those animals which he caught up and rent asunder. πλευροκοπῶν, slashing at their sides with his sword: a compound like θαλαττοκοπεῖν (Ar. Ev.. 830), μετεωροκοπεῖν (Pax 92). 237 (. ἀργίποδας: for the rt. ARG, denoting ‘brightness,’ and its derivatives, cp. O. C. 670 n. As Ajax purposed to og Odysseus (110), the ram which suffers that fate here might naturally be identified with him. The first ram, which is beheaded at once, might then represent Agamemnon; and Menelauis would here be ignored. On this view, however, there is a discrepancy with verses 97—1 30, since both the Atreidae are there supposed to be dead, while Odysseus has still to suffer. Here one ram (Agamemnon) is slain, and the other (Odysseus) flogged, in rapid succession. If the two rams are the two Atreidae, then Odysseus is ignored here. This would be consistent both with v. 97— 110 and with 298—306. The flogging of the second ram here would correspond with the words τοὺς δὲ δεσμίους [ ᾐκίζεθ' in 299 f. Then came the colloquy of Ajax with Athena (301); after which, he slowly regained his sanity,—before he had inflicted the lash upon Odysseus. That the ‘two rams’ are here the royal lrethren might be suggested by the analogy of the two eagles in Ag. 11. On the other hand, the special ferocity with which Ajax treats the second ram rather indicates that it represents Odysseus. There would be no point in so distinguishing Menelauis from Agamemnon. On the whole, it seems most probable that the oet meant Agamemnon and Odysseus, ut was careless of strict consistency with vV97—110. 288 καφαλὴν καὶ γλῶσσαν ἄκραν. He first shears off the head; then, still holding it, while the carcass drops to the ground, cuts off the end of the tongue; and next hurls both head and tongue from him. ἄκρα γλῶσσα can mean the extremity, the tip, of the tongue, as in Theocr. 9. 30 ἐπὶ γλώσσας ἄκρας: so in Ph. 748 ἄκρον πόδα is the heel. It could not mean, ‘the toongue from the roots,’ γλῶσσαν πρυμνήν (Il. 5. 292).—It was customary to cutt out the tongues of animals slain for sacrifice, and to offer them separately (Od. 3. 32: Ar. Pax 1060). But I doubt whether there is any reference here to the sacrificial custom ; the act of Ajax rather expresses merely fierce hatred of a slanderer.

In the latter place, it is confirmed by Athenaeus p. 65 ", for he has ῥιπτοῦντα in his parraphrase. ῥιπτεῖν, used only in pres. and impf., was current in Attic (Ar. Eccl. 50ε θ̓ιπτεῖτε χλαίνας). It has good authority in Thuc. 5. 1035 1 (ἀναρριπτοῦσι), and Xen. Cyneg. 9. 20 (ῥπτοῦσι). In Tragedy it is nowhere required by metre; and Elmsley (on Eur. Heracl. 150) supposes that the tragic poets used only ῥίπτω. No difference of sense between ῥιπτέω an ῥίπτω can be clearly shown; though it has been fancied that ῥιπτέω implies the frequency or vehemence of the act (iacto as compared with iacio).

The reading of the best Mss., both here and in the strophe (221 f.), can be retained, if in the strophe we make the slight change of ἀνδρὸς ε ἀνέρος. If, on the other hand, we strike out τοι here, then we must also change κρᾶτα to κάρα, or else, keeping κρᾶτα, change ἐδήλωσας in 221 to ἐδειξας or ἔφηνας. 2Th impf. ἐδήλους would be unsuitable.) Here τοι is quite in place, as introducing the comment.

sc. ὁ Αἴας τῆς νόσου: cp. 279. The subject to εὐτυχεεῖν is rather ἡᾶς than αὐτόν : the thought is, δοκῶ ὅτι εὐτυχοῖμεν ἄν. Cp. O.

In the omission of the subject to the inf., as in πέπαυται and in τοῦ κακοῦ, there is a shade of reticence which suits the recent sense of horror in the speaker's mind.

(gen. abs.) is an easy and specious conjecture, yet οὐ νοσοῦντες is better ; because (I) it gives a rhetorical antithesis to ἀτώμεσθα which suits her point ; and (2) it suggests the identity of their interest with that of Ajax. The figurative sense of νοσεῖν is often found in juxtaposition with the literal, as in O. T. 60 νοσεῖτε πάντες, καὶ νοσοῦντες, ὡς ἐγὼ | οὐκ ἔστιν ὑμῶν ὅστις ἐξ ἴσου νοσεῖ.

The fact that despair has succeeded to frenzy argues that he is under the spell of some angry god. When the malady passed away, his mind ought to have recovered a healthy tone. They had already hinted at a θεία νόσος as a possibility (186). μηδέν τι: Eur. Andr. 1234 μηδέν τι λίαν : Alc. 522 οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον οἶδα.

to τύχαις, dependent on ξυναλmeans here, ‘at dead of night.’ The only other instance of ἄκρος so used (natural though the use is) seems to be Theocr. 11. 36 τυρὸς δ’ οὐ λείπει μ’ οὔτ’ ἐν θέρει οὔτ’ ἐν ὀπώρῃ, | οὐ χειμῶνος ἄκρω (‘depth of winter’). Elsewhere ἄκρα νύξ means either (1) the beginning of night, nightfall, as in Aratus 775 ἄκρῃ νυκτί: or (2) the verge between night and dawn, as ib. 308 ἀκρόθι νυκτός. In Theophrastus De Sign. Pluv. 1. § 2 (p. 389 ed. Wimmer) the ἀκρόνυχοι ἀνατολαί of stars are their risings ὅταν ἅμα δυομένῳ ἀνατέλλῃ (τὰ ἄστρα), i.e. soon after sunset, at nightfall. The sense of ἀκρέσπερος varies like that of ἄκρα νύξ. In Hippocr. Epidem. 7. 653 ἀκρέσπερος φρίκη is a chill at the approach of evening (as Galen Exeg. p. 418 explains); while in Nicander Ther. 25 ἀκρέσπερος is explained by the schol. as= ‘at the close of evening,’ ‘at nightfall.’ The latter is the sense of ἄκρᾳ σὺν ἑσπέρᾳ in Pindar P. 11. 10. [In Arist. H. A. 9. 34, p. 619 b 21, the words ἄχρις ἑσπερίου have been conjecturally changed to τὴν ἀρχέσπερον, from Athen. p. 353 B or to τὴν ἀκρέσπερον: the sense required is ’at nightfall.’]

These were braziers, heat (Od. 19. 64 φόως ἐμὲν ἠδὲ θέρεσθαι). Od. 18. 307 αὐτίκα λαμπτῆρας τρεῖς ἴστασαν ἐν μεγάροισιν, | ὄφρα φαίνοιεν· περὶ δὲ ξύλα κάγκανα θῆκαν, |. . .. καὶ δαΐδας μετέμισγον. As. Helbig remarks (Das Hom. Epo p. 78), the smoke thus caused explains why the Homeri μέγαρον is sometimes called αἰθαλόεν (Il. 2. 414, Od. 2. 2359). For this mode of indicating the time, cp. Her. 7. 215 περὶλύχνων ἁφᾶς: Propeert. 3. 8. 1 ad extremas . . lucernas : Aul. Gelius 3. 2 post primam facem. 287 ἔγχος: cp. 95.—ἐξόδους ἔρπειν : cp.

The general word, ἄκλητος, is defined by the two clauses in apposition with it, οὔθ’ ὑπ’ ἀγγέλων κληθείς, οὔτε σάλπιγγός του κλύων. Here the double οὔτε is more emphatic than a double οὐδέ: with the latter, the sense would be, ‘uncalled, and not summoned,’ etc. Cp. Tr. 391 οὐκ ἐμῶν ὑπ’ ἀγγέλωων | ἀλλ' αὐτόκλητος. Aesch. Cho. 838 ἥκω μὲν οὐκ ἄκλητος, ἀλλ' ὑπάγγελος. ἀφορρμε͂ͅ, intrans., as in Thuc. 4. 78 § 5 ἐκ τῆς Μελιτίας ἀφώρμησεν (‘he started.): πεῖραν is cogn acc.; cp. Plat.

Cp. Hes. Theog. 183 ἀπέσσυθεν (ard pl.) σσυθείς occurs in O. C. 119, and συθῶμεν ib. 1724 : ἐσύθη in Eur. Helem. 1302 (lyr.). 205 τὰς ἐκεῖ. . πάθας: bbriefy described by Athena, 55-60. The Chorus knew no details (2139 f).. τύχας (cr. n..) is a weaker v. l.. The fem. πάθη occurs also in Ant. 979 and O. C. 7. 297 κύνας βοτῆρας: schol. τοὺς ποιμενικοὺς κύνας· οὐ γὰρ ἀναιρεῖ κατὰ τὴν σκηνὴν ἄνθρωπον.ηὔερον is a certain emendation of εὔκερων, which was doubtless due to a reminiscence of v. 64. (Bellermann, who retains εὔκερων, refers it to the horns of the rams; while Prof. Campbell, who also keeps it, says, ‘The word describess all the cattle, small and great, excepting the bulls, which have been mentioned separately.’)]) The form ὕερος (Attic for εὔειρος), from εἶρος, ‘wool, occurs in Tr. 675 (οίὸς εὐέρου) and. is proved by metre in Ar. Av. 121. The mention of the shemherd’s dogs is naturallv followed by that of the sheev. 208 . ηὐχένιζε (a word not elsewhere found in classical Greek) neans here, ‘beheaded,’ by a blow on the αιὐχήν (cervix), or hinder part of the neck. (Cp. Pind. P. 2. 933 ἐπαυχένιον . ..ζυγόν.) The Homeric δειροτομεῖν (Il. 21. 89, etc.) may have suggested αὐχενίζειν. ἄνω τρέπων, turning the heads of the victims upwards, so as to expose the throats to the sword. Cp. Il. 1. 459 αὐέρυσαν μὲν πρῶτα καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν: where αὐέρυσαν is now explained as ἀ〈·έρυσαν, by assimilation for ἀν·ξερ, ‘they lifted up’ the heads of the victims (not αὖ ἔρυσαν, ‘drew back,’ as itt was formerly taken): see Leaf ad loc.—ἔσφαζε (235), cut the σφαγή, iugulum. The whole neck is τράχηλος, collum.—κάρράχιζε: see on 56. μίους: cp. 239 ff. -—ὥστε ὡν, an epic use frequent with Aesch. and Soph.: . C. 343, etc.—φῶτας, here opposed, as ἄνδρας is in 64, to θῆρας: sometimes φως is opp. to θεός (Il. 17. 98 etc.. 501 f. ὑπᾴξας is not a certain reading here ; but (despite the fact that the first hand in L wrote ἀπᾶξας) it has, on the whole, at least as good authority as ἀπᾴξας. The latter makes good sense enough, ‘rushing away from me’; but ὑπᾴξας, expressing the sudden rush forward, as if towards something which had suddenly caught his attention, adds a picturesque touch which is absent from the other reading. For this sense of ὑπό in comp., cp. ὑπάγω, etc. The third possibility, ἐπᾴξας, would properly denote a rush onwards in a direction which had already been taken; and is thus les flitting here. σκιᾷ τινὶ: Tecmessa, of course, followed Ajax to the door, but Athena was invisible to her: see on 15. Ajax seemed to speak with some phantom,—some creature of his brain.—λόγους ἀνέσπα; the phrase denotes the abrupt, spasmodic manner in which his words were ierked forth. They were wild and incoherent (21-116). Cp. Plat. Theaet. p. 180 A σπερ ἐκ φαρέτρας ῥημαίσκια αἰνιγματώδη ἀνασπ͂ντες ἀποτοξεύουσι. Menander Ῥαπιζομένης fr. 7 πόθτν τοούτους ἀνεσπάκασιν οὗτοι τοὺς λόγους; Ar. Ran. 903 τὸν δ' (Aeschylus) ἀνασπῶντ’ αὐτοπρέμνοις (-ους2) | τοῖς λόγοισιν κ.τ.λ., (where the idea is that of tearing up trees by the roots; but the use of ἀνασπᾶν in ref. to a bold style is suggestive). Eustathius p. 679. 61 οὐ μόνον ἐπὶ φυτῶν τὸ ἀνασπὰν λέγεται, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ ἀλαζοείας, ὡς δηλοῖ τὸ παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ λόγους ἀνέσπα. 'Ἀτειδῶν κάτ: for κατά vlaced after its case, cp. 969. 506 ἀμφ’ Ὀδυσσεῖ: for ἀμφί with dat. in this sense, cp. 340, 684 : El. 1180 ἀμφ’ ἐμοὶ στένεις.—συντιθεὶς γέλων πολύν, ‘combining,’ ‘mingling,’ much laughter with the vaunts: cp. Aesch. Suppl. 65 ξυντίθησι δὲ παιδὸς μόρον, zlends that theme with her lament.—Not, ‘fabricating,’ with reference to the unreality of the triumph.—γέλων, as in Ant. 647 : but γέλωτ' below, 382, 958. Eur. too uses γέλων where it is metrically convenient (Ion 1172).. The. form implies an Attic declension, like that of νεώς. In Od. 18. 350 and 20. 36 γέλον should prob. be read; in the former place the MSS. give also γέλω and γέλων. Stems in τare post-Homeric, as Monro observes (Hom. Gr. § 107 n). 504 ὕβριν i plainly that which he inficts, not that which he punishes ; though the latter would be suggested by the usual sense of ἐκτίνεσθαι, as in Eur. H. F. 547 μή ποτ Κρέοντος θάνατον ἐκτεισαίατο ('avenge ’). Here the verb means, ’inflict in vengeance.’—ἐκτείσαιτο (for the spelling, see on 181), not ἐκτείσουτο : the latter would be tenable only if αὐτοῦ could replace αὐτῶν. When he spoke with Athena, he fancied that he had already slain the Atreidae(10)); and Odysseus, though reserved for further chastisement, was already δεσμώτης (105..——ἱών ( ὅτε ᾔε) addn animation; see on Ant. 768 δράτω, φρονείτω μεῖζυν ἢ κατ' ἄρνθ' ἰών. 505 ἐπᾴξας is better here than ἀπᾴξας. The regular sense of ἐπᾴσσειν is ‘to rush at,’ or ‘against’; here it denotes that he rushes in again as if to renew the attack. ἀπᾴξας, on the other hand, would be somewhat awkward, since he was coming towards the speaker ; and certainly cannot be defended by Tr. 693 εἴσω δ’ ἀποστείχουσα, where Deianeira means, ‘as I was going. avay from you into the house.’ It is quite needless to write ἐσᾴξας.—αἵθις.. πάλιν: O.

For πως thus used, cp. also Il. 14. 104 μάλα πώς με καθίκεο θυμὸν ἐνιπῇ, ‘thou hast strangely moved me.’ 507 ἄτης, the havoc made by him; cp. Ant. 1260 (alluding to the corpse of aemon), οὐκ ἀλλοτρίαν [ ἄτην, ‘the work of no stranger's madness. 308 f. *θώϋξεν. In O. C. 1624 this word begins a trimeter, the augment being omitted, as often in ῥήσεις (see O. T. 1249 n.): here, however, it is better to suppose aphaeresis. Cp. 1337 κράτησα.—ἐρειπίοις is defined by νεκρῶν, wrecks consisting of corpses; and this phrase, again, by dἀρνείου φόνου, corpsewrecks of slain sheep. Thus both the genitives here serve to define; while in λείας.βουκόλων φρουρήματα (54), the first gen. defines, and the second is possessive. Cp. 465, 616 f. The phrase νεκρῶν ἐρείπια occurs also in Eur. fr. 266. 2; and χλανιδίων ἐρειπίοις (which seems to verge on bathos) in frag. incert. 7 (ed. Nauck). ἐρειφθεὶς: the pres. pass. ἐρείπεται (‘crashes down’) occurs in O. C. 1462 ; this aor., in Arrian Anab. I. 21. 4 (of a tower) οὐδὲ .. χαλεπῶς ἂν ἠρείφθη. Pind. Ol. 2. 47 has ἐριπέντι. The old v. l. ἐρεισθεὶς would mean, ‘supported on,’ but is wretchedly weak. The very fact that ἐρειφθεὶς follows ἐρειπίοιςς—that the slayer is prostrate among the slain—giyes the word a singular force and pathos. 710 ἀπρἰξ.. συλλαβὼν, tightly clutching: Plat. Theaet. 155 P οὗ ἂν δύνωνται ἀπρὶξ τοῖν χεροῖν λαβέσθαι. Cp. fr.. 328. 3 τοῦ γε κερδαίνειν ὅμως ἀπρὶξ ἔχονται. The word is from the rt. of πρίω, as z ‘to grip’ (030 n.), with euphonic a: Aesch. uses ἄπριγδα (Pers. 1057). Cp. the Latin phrase mordicus tenere. ὄνυξι... χερί, vith the hand, lr the nails; both datives are instrumental, but one (ὄνυξι) more closely defines the other; see on 230 f. (χερὶ..ξίφεσιν). 511 καὶ τὸν μὲν ἦστο πλεῖσστον κ.τ.λ. The bold order of words is explained by ἔπειτα in 412) 1)e., the thought is; ‘for one part of the time—the longest —he sat mute; then,’ etc. By separating τὸν from πλεῖστον, the writer obtains the same effect as if he had said, καὶ πρῶτον μὲν καὶ τὸν πλεῖστον χρόνον κ.τ.λ. 512 τὰ δείν’.. ἔπη, ‘those dread threats’ (which still haunt my memory): cv. 6z0. 1226:. Eur. P. 18 ποῦ δ’. ὃς τὰ δεινὰ τῇδ' ἐφυβρίζει πόλει | Καπανεύς; ‘those dread vaunts’ (of which we have heard). See Tr. 476, and Appendix there, p. 192. 518 φανοίην. The optat. of the fut. φανέω is formed with the modal suffix η, like the pres. optat. of contracted verbs, δρα·ο-ειη·ν., δρῴην. Cp. Xen. Cyr. 3. I. 14 ἐροίη (opt. of fut. ἐρέω): Platonic Epist. 7. p. 339 D διαβαλοίην. 514 ἐν τῷ πράγματον: cp. Ant. 1229 ἐν τῷ συμφορᾶς δδιεφθάρης; Ph. 174 ἐπὶ παντί τῳ χρείας. The words καγώ, φίλοι, δείσασα are apologetic; she would gladly have spared him the details which his threats constrained her to relate. 1 f. πρὸς γὰρ κακοῦ τε: for the rep., cp. 581, 1071. He always set orth, laid down as a rule, τοιούσδε γόους ἔχειν πρὸς ἀνδρὸς κακοῦ, pertain to him, are characteristic of him. The words, πρὸς ἀνδρὸς κακοῦ κ.τ.λ, are equiv. to an adverb with the intrans. ἔχειν: i.et., as we can say, γόοι ἀνάνδρως ἔχουσι, so γόοι ἔχουσι πρὸς κακου ἀνδρός. This intrans. use of ἔχειν with phrases of an adverbial kind is frequent with Herodotus; e.g. 2. 91 ἀγῶνα γυμνικὸν διὰ πάσης ἀγωνίης ἔχοντα, ‘consisting in every sort of contest’: see other examples on O. T. 709. —The alternative explanation is, he taught that it (was) the part of a craven ἔχειν γόους τοιούσδε, to indulge in such laments.’ ἔχειν would then be used as in Od. 24. 515 δῆριν ἔχουσι. Bl this implies an impossible ellipse of εἶναι after ἐξηγεῖτο. βαρυψύχου, ‘heavy-hearted,’ lacking the buoyant spirit which quickly ralies itself from despondency. Ajax was emphatically a soldier. (The schol.’s parahrase, μικροψύχου, conveys a different idea.) The word occurs nowhere else, βαρύθυμος being the usual term; but cp. βαρύφρων, and the post-classical βαρυκάρδιος. Plutarch illustrates the poet’s meaning when he speaks (Mor. p. 477 E) of men ἐν ὀδυρμοῖς τὰ πολλὰ καὶ βαρυθυμίαις καὶ μερίμναις.. διατρίβοντας. So Heracles says, Tr. 1074, ἀλλ’ ἀστένακτος αἰὲν εἰπόμην κακοῖς. ἐξηγειῖτ’ : the word implies authoritative exposition (as of the sacred law by the ἐξηγηταί), and suggests the submissive reverence with which Tecmessa listened to her lord. 621 f. ἀψόφητος . . κωκυμάτων : cp. O. C. 67 ἀνήνεχον . χειμώνων (n.).— ὑπεστέναζε, groaned low; cp. El. 79 ὑποστενούσης.—ὐξέων : Ant. 423 πικρᾶς | ὄρνιθος ὀξὺν φθόγγον.—ταῦρος ὢς βρυχώνοςς: Hes. Theog. 832 ταῦρος ἐριβρύχης. he word expresses deep, sullen tones, such as might come from a bull in pain : it usually implies a sound of anger or anguish, whereas μυκάσθαι can denote the mere lowing of oxen; hence Nonnus 29. 311 βρυχηδὸν ἐμυκήσαντο. The unhappy conjecture βριμώμενος (snorting’) was prompted by a supposed inconsistency between βρυχώμενος and ὑπεστέναζε : but there is no reason why deep tones siould not be also mufKed. 328 νῦν δ’ contrasts his present behaviour with that described in 317. The contrast is not with ὑπεστέναζε (3722), as though he were now wholly silent. 324 t. ἄσιτος. Od. 4. 788 (Penelope in her anxiety for Telemachus) κεῖτ’ ἀρ ἄσιτος ἄπαστος ἐδητύος ἠδὲ ποτῆτος. σιδηροκμῆσιν : as the dead are οἱ καμόντες, ὁ κεκμηκότες, so σιδηροκμής is one who has died by the sword: cp. Aesch. Cho. 365 δουρικμῆτι λαῷ : ib. 889 ἀνδροκμῆτα πέλεκυν (an axe by which men die). 526 ὥς τι δρασείων, instead of δρασείων τι simply : cp. O. C. 630 ὡς τελῶν ἐφαίνετο: Xen. A. 1. 5. 9 δῆλος ἦν Κῦρος ὡς σπεύδων : Lys. 0r. 12 § 90 δῆλοι ἔσεσθε ὡς ὀργιζύμενοι.—ρασείων: cp. Ph. 1001 ἐργασσέειν (a.)· Ar. Vep, 168 ἀνθρωπος οὗτος μέγα τι δρασείει κακόν. 527 τοιαῦτα is qualified by πως : something in his utterances, which she cannot define, suggests this. Cp. Xen. Cyr. 3. 3. 7 ἔλεξεν ὧδέ πως εἰς τὸ μέσον. —καὶ λέγει κώδύρεται. The word ἡσυυχος in 325 does not imply silence; it contrasts the quietness of his present demeanour with his former frenzy, and with the first vehemence (317) of his ief. His occasional words, or laments such as ἰώ μοί μοι, 333), are in a tone which foreshadows the worst. The verse is rejected by Nauck and others as though it were inconsistent with v. 325, and had been patched up from v. 383. There is no ground for this view. On the other hand, after ἥσυχος in 325, the fear expressed in 326 would be unintelligible, if no reason were subjoined. Bergk, who joins in condemning the verse, allows that Sophocles is usually carelul of logical coherence in drama ('ſfegt .. sorgfältig yu motiviren;; but suggests that Cere the neglect of it might be ‘a mark of the archaic style (2ahr. f. Class. Phil. 97. 378). A8 A. ἐστάλην, her (self-imposed crrand ; cp. El. 44 οἷπερ ἐστάλην ὁδοῦ: 0. C. 20 προὐστάλη. δισελύόντες. Dramatic effect required that, instead of the Chhorus literally complying with this request, the interior of the tent should be disclosed to them (346). 559. λόγοις. The φίλοι of the mss. was doubttless in its origin a mere overseight, but. may have been helped to kesp its place in the text by the construction in 1353, κρατεῖς τοι τῶν φίλων νικώμενος. 512. Τυλεύταντος: 21on.—ἡμῖν could. be joined with λέγεις: for ’we sometimes find a word devoid of emphasis standing first in a trimetter, though a slight pause follows; e.s. 847 ἴδηςς Aesch. Ag. 130 οὐ κομπάσαιμ’ ἃν θεσφάτων γνώμων ἄκρος εἶναι, κακῷ δέ τῳ προσει· κάζω τάδε: P. V. 673 διάστροφοι ἠσαν, κεραστὶς δ' κ.τ.λ. But on the whole it seems bet ter to have a comma after λέγεις, and to take ἡμῖν as ethic dat. ('to our sorrow: though this, too, is slightly harsh; for such an ethic dat. ought not to stand first, but to follow some significant word, as in 216 μανίᾳ γγὰρ ἁλοὺς ἡμὶν ὁ κλεινός El. 272 τὸν αὐτοέντην ἡμίν. διαπεφοιβάσθαι: the compound occurs only here.. φοιβάζω, from Φοῖβος, meant ‘ to inspire,’ as Apollo inspires the divine frenzy of μάντις or of poet ; Anthol. 9. 525. 2 Φοῖβον, φοιβάζοντα, φιλοστέφανον, φιλογηθῆ : Longinus 8 § 4 πάθος φοιβάζον τοὺς λόγους. ((The word could mean also ‘ to utter prophetically,’ as in Lycophron 6 δαφνηφάγων φοίβαζεν ἐκ λαιμῶν ὄπα.) Tecmessa has just described both the recent frenzy of Ajax-which she had already pictured in vv. 233 ff.—and his present despair. By διαπεφοιβάσθαι the Chorus mean that a malign power has taken permanent pssession of his mind. The mental trouble outlasts the frenzy (279 f). Both διά, and the perfect tensee, serve to mark this. By κακοῖς they mean his troubles in regard to the arms of Achlles. 5 ἱώ μοί μοι. Cp. El. 77, where a similar cry (behind the scenes) is a prelude to the heroine’s entrance. 354 μᾶλλον : we understand νοσήσει, or the like.—ἢ οὐκ: the same crasis as in O. T. 55, 993, 110.—Αἴαντος, οἴαν κ.τ .λ.: cp. 785 ὅρα . . τόνδ’ ὁποῖ’ ἔπη θροεῖ. As in 308 θώϋξεν marked the first pangs of his despair, θωὔσσει here denotes a fresh access. 37 f. τοῖς πάλαι νοσήμασι ξυνοῦσι τοῖς πάλαι ξυνοῦσι ν. : for the irregular order, cp. Ph. 1316 τὰς . . ἐκ θεῶν | τύχας δοθείσας (n.). The sense is τοῖς ν. α πάλαι ξυνῆν. If the order of words were normal, ξυνοῦσι would be predicate ; ‘vexed by his former maladies, as they haunt him,’ ὅτε ξύνεστιν. But then (1) the alternative to ἢ νοσεῖν is less clearly marked, since the old νοσήματα are, in a sense, still with him; and (2) ξυνοῦσι, as referring merely to a memory of them, is somewhat forced.—παρῶν, being. as he is, in the presence of his own handiwork. The implied antithesis is with what he might feel if told of things which he had done elsewhere. but which he coud not see. Cp. 1131, 1156. 330 ιὼ παῖ παῖ.. One of the sigs that he is resolved to die is the way in which his thoughts dwell upon his son; he cannot rest till he sees him (530—544). The child is the heir of his fame, and may live to clear it of the stain (556 f.). As Eurysaces is not at once brought to him, he next cries (342), Τεῦκρον καλῶ: Teucer is his second thought, for to Teucer he will commit the care of his son (562). Prof. Campbell understands ἰὼ παῖ παῖ as meaning Teucer,whom an elder brother might so address. Tecmessa, at least, did not so take the words. 340 1. ὤμοι τάλαινν : the nom. as in 800, El. 788, and oft.—Ευρύσακες, so named from the shield of Ajax (19 ): cp. 574 n. The first syll. of a dactyl in the third foot is usually either the last sylllable of a word, or else a monosyllable ; but proper names are exemptt from the rule. ι σοὶ: for the prep., cp. 303 : in 562 the sense is different. ποῦ ποτ’ εἶ; She had sent the child out of the tent, in charge of servants (531-539), and now fears that he has not been removed to a sufficient distance. 542 f Τεῦκοον : the son of Telamon by Hesione) (1302), and half-brother of [Ajax,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) whose mother was [Eriboea](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1295435) (569). —τὸν

deeds; cp. 21. The ἐκκύκλημα is now pushed on through the central door. It was a small stage, but large enough to allow of [Ajax](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) being shown surrounded by some of the slaughtered animals. The word πράγη in 347, and the language of vv. 351 ff., show that the carnage was represented. The other plays in which [Sophocles](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11950683) has used the eccyclema are the [Antigone (1294,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg002:(1294,) where see n.), and the [Electra (1464 f.,](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg005:(1464f.,) n.). [Ajax,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) siting among his victims, and meditating his own destruction, was the subject of a famous picture by [Timomachus of Byzantium.](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7806922) [Philostratus ( Vit. Apoll. 2. 22 § 5)](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0638.tlg001:2.22§5)) thus describes it: τὸν Αἴαντα τὸν Τιμομάχου..ἀπεκτονότα τἀν τῇ Τροίᾳ βουκόλια καθῆλσθαι ἀπειρηκότα [cp. v. 345 ἥσυχος θακεῖ], βουλὴν ποιούμενον καὶ ἑαυτὸν διαφθεῖραι.The picture was at [Cyzicus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q615449) in 70 B.c.

See Introduction § 20. 348-429 This kommos serves, like the last (201—262), as a lyric expression of tragic pathos; after which the situation is further developed, as in the former case, by iambic dialogue. But in one respect this kommos differs from its predecenssor. In order to bring the mind of [Ajax](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) into ſuller relief, the lyrics are given to him alone, while the Chorus and [Tecmessa](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10796858) speak only trimeters. The structure is as follows :—lst strophe 348—355 = 1st antistr. 356-363 : 2nd str. 364-378= 2nd ant. 379-393: 3rd str. 394-411D 3rd ant. 417-479. For the metres see Metrical Analysis. 348 t. ἱὼ φίλοι ναυβάται: his first words mark the affection which was so deep in the rugged nature.—ἐμμένοντενς Cp. [O. T. 351](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg004:351) (τῷ κηρύγματι) ἐμμένειν.ὀρθῷ νόμῳ, the right, sound rule of loyalt to friendship—which the Greek chiefs have forsaken. 351 t. ἴδεσθέ μ': for this midd. aor., cp. [Ph. 351](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006:351) n. The constr. is as in [Aesch. P.

[Pind. O. 2. 1](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0033.tlg001:2.1) οἱ δ’ ἀνιαραῖ ιἀντικύρσαντες ζάλαι ἐσλὸν ζαθὺ πήματος ἐν μικρῷ πεδάμειψαν χρόνῳ. The epithet φοινίας, denoting the afct of the ζάλη (i.e., really belonging, in sense, to κῦμαι), has a more vivid fitness than in O. [T. 24, where](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg004:where) by βυθῶν ...φοινίου σάλου is meant the pestilence. ἀμφίδρομον, ‘running around’ me.κυκλῖταιι: this rare midd. is read in Her. 8. 16, μηνοειδὲς ποιήσαντες τῶν νεῶν ἐκυκλεῦντο ὡς περιλάβοιεν αὐτού. But in fr. 787. 2 κυκλεῖται is pass.; and so [Ellendt](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18411800) would taake it here ('is rolled around me “-——needlessly, I think. κυκλοῦται would be the more usual midd. form (Her. 3, 157, and oft.). 54 f. οἰμ': this elision occurs in 587; [Ant. 320, 1270;](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg002:320,1270) [Ar. Ach. 590.](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg001:590.) Though it breaks the rule of Tragedy against eliding diphthongs, it was doubtless too familiar to offend the ear. The οἳ ἐμὲ δειλήν in Anth. 9. 408 does not warrant us in supposing that οἴμ' = 0οἴ με. ἀφροντίστως ἐχει. Cp. [Tr. 366](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg001:366) πέμπων οὐκ ἀφροντίστως: [Xen. Cyr. 1. 6. 42](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg007:1.6.42) μηδεποτ’ οὗν ἀφροντίστως ἔχε, ‘never be heedless.’ For the pass. form of the word, cp. δυσλόγιστον (40 n.). It is not easy to decide whether the subject to ἔχει is [Ajax,](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) or τοὔ́ργον: but the usage of the adverb rather favours the view that it is [Ajax.](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q172725) The phrase is designedly euphemistic and reticent. 557 ναῗας ἀρωγὸν τέχνας, helpful of the seaman’s art, i.e., its ministers : the en., as in Aesch. Eum. 486 ἀρωγὰ τῆς κης ὁρκώματα. Cp. 201. 358 ἅλιον ὃς ἐἐπέβας is the ‘kest correction of ἁΛίαν ἣς ἐπέβας. The two short syllables ἣς ἐπthen correspond with a long syllable (the first of ἐμμένοντες in v. 350 ; s the dochmiac metre allows. Hermann's later emendation, ὁς ἁλίαν ἕβας, avoids, indeed, resolving the long syllable, but unwarrantably alters ἐπέβας: non is there much force in his reason for preferring it, viz., that the gloss ἐπέβας τῶν εῶν points to ἀλιᾶ.. πλατᾶν, and this to ἁλίαν (rather than ἅλιον) πλάταν. Cp. Eur. Heracl. 82 ἁλίῳ πλάτᾳ. ὁς follows γένος, as in 760 ὄστις refers to σώματα in 758, and in Ant. 707 ff. ὅστις is resumed bν οὗτοι.—ἐπέβας, absol., ‘embarked’ (as in Thuc. 7. 62 § 2 ἐπιβήσονται),—recalling the moment when they set forth from Salamis together; a point which is lost if ἐπέβας be taken as =* thou hast come hither.*-ἐλίσσων: cp. Eur. Or. 171 πόδα σὸν εἰλίξεις, i.e., ‘move swiftly. 560 πημονὰν ἐπαρκέσοντ-: cp.

Thus, though ἐπαρκεῖν could not mean literally ‘to ward of,’ epic precedent warranted its use in an equivalent sense, which was strictly that of bringing one help against a danger. In lyrics, at least, where epic associations have a large scope, it seems needless to write ἀπαρκέσοντο’. The traditional reading ποιμένων is explained by the schol. in L, τῶν ἐμὲ ποιμαινόντων και θαλπόντων: i..e., the sense was taken to be, ‘I see that thou, alone of my sheperds (= of those who care for m), canst help.’ But ποιμένων, in such a context, would suggest rather the idea of chieftainship (cp. ποιμένα λαῶν, ναῶν ποιμένε8 in Aesch. Suppl. 767): and there can be little doubt that πημονὰν is right. 361 ἀλλά, appealing : cp. O. 14, etc.: Pind.

Plant. 9. 16 § 1 ὀλίγος ὁ τόπος ὁ φέρων, καὶ τοῦτον αἱ αἶγες ἐκνέμονται, depascunt, ‘the region which bears (the plant dictamnum) is small, and is stripped of it by the browsing goats.’ The analogy of Pind. N. 6. 15, ἴχνεσιν ἐν Πραξιδάμαντος ἑ’ν πόδα έμων, would certainly point to ἐκνεμεῖς, but we must allow for the poetical use of the middle voice, so frequent with Sophocles.

Dem. or. 18 § 296 ἄνθρωποι μιαροὶ καὶ κόλακες καὶ ἀλάστορες, ἠκρωτηριασμένοι τὰς ἑαυτῶν ἕκαστοι πατρίδας (“who have crippled their respective cities-),a passage which suggests that ἀλάστωρ, as said of a man, meant rather one who is a ‘cursè or ‘plague ’ to his neighbours, than one wh is driven by an avenging spirit ; indeed, such a passive sense is not easily conceived. κλυτοῦς: from the Homeric κλυτὰ μῆλα (Od. 9. 308).—αἰπολίοις: Il. 11. 679 αἰπόλια πλατέ’ αἰγῶν. This is the only express mention of goats among his victims ; but there is no reason to think that αἰπόλιον could be used as merely = ποίμνιον.ἐρεμνὸν: suggested doubtless by Aesch. Ag. 1390 ἐρεμνῇ ψακάδι φοινίας δρόσου.—οιἶμ’ ἔδευσα : cp. T. 848 τέγγει δακρύων ἄχναν (n.). 577 ἐπ’ ἐξειργασμένοις : ἐπὶ denots the condition : Aesch. Ag. 1379 ἕστηκα δ’ ἔνθ’ ἔπαισ’ ἐπ’ ἐξειργασμένοις. (The phrase occurs als in Pers. 525) Cp. Ant. 55 ἐπ’ ἀρρήτοις . . τοῖς ἐμοῖς λόγοι)ς (n..8. οὐ γὰρ γένοιτ’ ἂν κ.τ.λ. Two modes of expression are here mixed : (1) οὐκ ἃν γένοιτο τοῦτο οὐχ ὧδ’ ἔχειν, it could not come to pass that this shouuld not be thus. (2) οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο ὄπως τοῦτο οὐχ ἇδ' ἔξει, —wirh the same meaning : cp. O. T. 1058 f. οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο τοῦθ', ὅπως ἐγὼ .. . οὐ φανῶ τοὐμὸν γένος. In other words, the constr. would be plain if ὅπως were struck out. The irregular presence of ὅπως is due to its association with statements of impossibility in the formula οὐκ ἔστιν ὅπως οὐ (O. C. 97, El. 1479): its place is explained by the analogy of such a sentence as O. T. 1058 οὐκ ἀν γένοιτο τοῦθ, ὅπως κ.τλ., where τοῦτο is subject to γένοιτο. The declension of οὐδεὶς-ὄστιςοὐ, as an integral equivalent for πᾶς τις, similarly illustrates the manner in which the associations of idiom could sometimes generate anomalies in grammar. For the sentiment, cp. Tr. 742 τὸ γὰρ | φανθὲν τίς ἂν δύναιτ’ ἂν ἀγένητον ποεῖν; (n.. 575 f. πάνθ' ὁσο͂ο͂ν: as Philoctetes says to Odysseus, Ph. 1013 ἀλλ' ἡ κακὴ σὴ διὰ μυχῶν βλέπουσ' ἀὲ̀ ψυχή κ.τ.λ., ‘thy base soul, ever peering from some ambush.’ The conjecture πάντα δρῶν is not only weak, but incorrect, since the sense would require πᾶν δρῶν. ἁπάντων τ'. It is needles to change τ to δ’ : though δέ often occurs thus in ‘epanaphora,’ as Ant. 806 τὰν νεάταν ὁδὸν 4 στείχουσαν, νέατον δὲ φέγγος λεύσσουσαν (n.). Here the case for δ’ would be stronger if ἅπανθ' (and not πάνθ’) had preceded. κακῶν ὄργανον : cp. Ph. 407 (of Odysseus) ἔξοιδα γάρ νιν παντὸς ἂν λόγου κακοῦ | γλώσσῃ θιγόντα καὶ πανουργίας. 581 ἄλημα, ‘fine meal’ (ἀλέω), hence, ‘a subtle knave,’a word found only here and in 389.. παιπάλη (reduplicated from πάλη) had the same senses, literal and figurative; and παιπάλημα was a current term (Ar. Av. 430, Aeschin. or. 2§ 40). In fr. 827 Odysseus is called πάνσοφον κρότημα, as in Ph. 927 πανουργίας | δεινῆς τέχνημ’ ἔχθιστον.—For the early repetition of dἄλημα, in 389, cp. that of κείσομαι in Ant. 76 (n.). 582 ἦ που: cp. 176.—ἄγεις. The5 phrase ἄγειν γέλωτα denotes frequent or continued derision, as ἄγειν κτύπον ‘to keep up a noise ’: Eur. Or. 184 κτύπον ἠγάγετ’· οὐχὶ σῖγα κ.τ.λ. So νεῖκος ἄγειν, to sustain a conflict (Pind. F. 9. 33 ): σχολὴν ἄγειν, etc. 588 ξὺν τῷ θεῶν. Those who write ξ́ν τοι θεῷ here do so on the ground that σὺν θεῷ, not σὺν τῷ θεῷ, is the regular phrase when the sense is general, ‘wwith the divine aid’; whereas in O. T. 146 σὺν τῷ οεθε͂ͅ refers to a partcular god (Apolq]oBut there is an arbitrary rigour in this docarine. ὁ θεός often means ‘the divine generally: e.g. frag. adesp. 471 γ̀ρ θεὸς μέγιστος ἀνθρώποις νόμος and πόρρω γὰρ ἐστὼς ὁ θεὸς ἐγγύθεν And this very phrase, σὺν oῷ sccars once, at least, in a passage vdere cde context plainly indicates that vue ener is general, vix. Eur. fr. 490 σὺν μὲͅ δερῇ μὶ τοὺς σοφοὺς ἀναστρέφειν | βουdarterrt dai. Ttere, indeed, as here, Dnrrb acanges τῷ to τοι, but without eeee. x*.. The question whether L. Dindorf's remedy ἴδοιμι μήννιν, has this advantage over the others (cr. n.), that it gives a light adversative force, and so fitly responds to v. 383, ξὺν τῷ θεῷ κ.τ.λ. Triumph, like defeat, is the gift of heaven.’-‘Eret would that I could see him,’ etc. The next best conjecture is perhaps that of Apitz, ἴδοιμί νύν νιν. 386 μηδὲν μέγ’ εἴπῃ : cp. El. 830 μηδὲν μέγ' ἀιὔσῃς (n.). 337 f. προπάτωρ, a word used by Pindar, Eur., and Herodotus. The reading πάτερ (requiring χεροῖνinstead of χερὶ μὲν in 372) had an obvious and prosaic motive; viz., that Aeacus, the grandfather of Ajax, was the son of Zeus (Il. 21. 189)), so that Zeus could not groperly. de called. an ‘aceestnr’ of the hero’s ‘ancestors.’ But when the poet wrote προγόνων προπάτωρ, it was enough for him that it expressed the thought, 'author of my line’; he did not trouble himself with this subtlety.—It was the nymph Aegina who bore Aeacus to Zeus (Plat. Gorg. p. 526 E: τὸν δικαστὴν τὸν τῆς Αἰγίνης υἰόν). πῶς ἂν . .θάνοιμι: cp. Ph. 531 f. πῶς ἃν ὑμὶν ἐμφανὴς | ἔργῳ γενοίμην (n.). sao .. δισσάρχας (found only here): see on 251 δικρατεῖς——ὀλέσσας: cp. Ph. 1163 πέλασσον. (Below, in 927, some edd. read ἐξανύσσειν : see n. ther.) This epic licence in tragic lyrics is illustrated by their toleration of such forms as τόσσον (185), μέσσος, ζώειν Αl. 157, O. C. 1213), πνείειν (Ant. 1146), etc.— βασιλῆς is the form which the grammarians Draco and Herodian read here (cr. n.). But, so far as Attic inscrr. are available, they indicate that the acc. plur. from ευ stems ended in -έᾶς, always uncontracted; while the contraction in .οῖς (not οῆς) was the rule from the Macedonian age onwards. (The earliest example ofτοὺς βασιλεῖς quoted by Meisterhans, Gramm. Att. Inschr. § 39, belongs to 218-11I B.c. We must remarrd the acc. βασιλῆς here, then, not as an old Attic, but as a poetical form.. On the other hand, βασιλῆς was the form of the nom. plur. in the older Attic (cp. 189). Herodian (l. c., cr. n.) cites νομῆς from Xenophon, as if it were an acc. pl. like βασιλῆς here: but in the place to which he apparently refers (Cyr. 1. 1 § 2) it is nom., and the best recent edd. give νομεῖς. θάνοιμι καὐτός: cp. Aesch. Cho. 438 ἔπειτ’ ἐγὼ νοσφίσας ὀλοίμαν. 394 f. σκότος, the darkness of death, as the gates of Hades are σκότου πύλαι (Eur. Hec. 1): ἔρεβος, as in O. C. 1389 τὸ Ταρτάρου | στυγνυν..ἔρεβος. So, too, in Il. 8. 368 it is merely a term for ‘the nether gloom’ (ἐξ ἐρέβευς ἄξοντα), not a definitely named region, Erebos. — ὡς ἐμοί: for this limiting force of ὡς, cp. . C. 20 μακρὰν...ὡς γέροντι: Plat. Soph. p. 226 c ταχεῖαν, ὡς ἐμοί, σκέψιν. 309 f. ἵλεσθ' ἑλεσθέ μ': the most probable reading; see on 414. Here the midd. means, ftaxe to yourselves’ (and not, as normally, ‘choos)); it is thus more expressive than ἕλετε: cp. O. T. 887 κακά νιν ἔλοιτο μοῖρα. Conversely we find εὑρεῖν where εὑρέσθαι would be normal (El. 1061). 308 b. γένος, as well as ὄνασιν, is . governed by εἰς: cp. O. T. 734 Δελφῶν κἀπὸ Δααυλίας: ib. 1205 τίς ἄταις ἀγρίαις, τίς ἐν πόνοις: El. 780 οὔτε νυκτὸς. . οὔτ' εξ ἡμέρας.ἄξιος. For the ellipse of εἰμί, cp. 813 n.—βλέπειιν, to look for help; cp. El. 958 ἐς τίν’ ἐλπίδων | βλέψασ ἔτ’ ὀρθήν ν; 401 f. ἁ Διὸς...8θεὸς: cp. 450 : O. C. 623 χὼ Διὸς Φοῖβος.,ὀλέθριον should answer metrically to εὔφρονες in 420. If it be sound, the first syllable must reresent the anacrsis, which is omitted efore εὔφρονες: and the ε is long, as it is in 799 (ὀλεθρίαν), O. T. I341) (ὀλέθριον), and . C. 1683 (ὀλεθρία): thouh we find έ in Tr. 845 (ολεθρίαισι), and ib. 878 (ὀλεθρία). The neatest emendation is οὔλιιον (cr. n.). 406 f. φύγη...μενῶ. For the delib. subjunct. combined with fut. indic., cp. TΚ. 973 τί πάθω τί δὲ μήσομαι ; 405 b. εἰ τὰ μὲν φθίνει κ.τ.λ. The conjectures of various critics are recorded and classified in the Appendix. Here I will briefly state what seem the main points of the vroblem. (1) The antistrophic verses, 423—427 (ἐξερῶ.... πρόκειμαι), appear sound. The changes which have been proposed in . them have all been designed to suit some emendation in 405 ff., and would have no probability if verses 423 ff. were considered simply on theie own meris. (2) There is only one real discrepancy of metre between the traditional text here and that of the antistrophe; diz., that τοῖσδ] in 406 answers to the τινα f οὔτινα in 424, where the α, being the last syllable of a verse, could be either long or short, and is here long. (Some, indeed, read οὔτιν’ ἁ: cr. n.) That is, instead of τοῖσδ', we require .. As to ἐξερέω in 423, answering to εἰ τὰ μὲν in 405, we should write ἐξερῶ. With regard to the diction of 405 ff., the most suspicious point isthe redundancy ὁμοῦ πέλας, suggesting that one of the words was a gloss upon the other. (3) If, then, we assume that the antistrophe is sound, we may conclude that the fault in the strophe lies within the words εἰ τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλαν. A very slight change will restore the metre, viz. τοιοῖσδ' for τοῖσδς': cp. the words of Ajax in 453 ὥστ’ ἐν τοιοῖσδε χεῖρας αἰμάξαι βοτοῖς. There he points to the slain cattle around him ; and so he probably does here also. We could then understand the sense to be : 'If those things (τὰ μὲν, his glories in the past) perish, my friends, ὁμοῦ τοιοῖσδε, along with (i.e., by the slaughter of ) such creatures, πέλας, near me there’. But πέλας may have been a marginal gloss (on ὁμοῦ), which has displaced some other word: e.g., the poet may have written τοιοῦτδ’ ὁμοῦ βοτοῖς (cp. v. 453). (4) Whatever may have been the original form of the words εἰ τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλας, it is at least highly probable that their general sense was, ‘If my old renown is perishing.’ This is suggested by the other passages where we find the same sequence of ideas,—i.e., the thought of his past glory closely followed by that of his present disgrace; see (1) 4 1-427 : (2) 437-456: (3) 612-—621. (5) Those who celieve that the antistrophic verses 423—427 are corrupt have a freer hand for emendation here; and, as will be seen in the Appendix, some of the proposed restorations have been very bold. But such remedies pass into the region of pure guess-work. 407 προσκείμεθα, ‘addicted’ to them. Her. 3, 34. φιλοινί...προσκέεσθαι. The word can also denote, in a god sense, that to which the attention is given, as Thuc. (1. 935 8) says of Themistocles, ταῖς γὰρ ναυσὶ μάλιστα προσέκειτο.—μώ́ραις. L has μωραῖς (as it has μωρὰν in El. 890), that being the later accent, according to the general rule that adjectives in -ρος are oxytone. But the grammarians attest that the Attic accent was μῶρος. See, e.g., Eustath. p. 245. 17 μῶρος παρ Ἀττικοῖς, ὁ παρὰ τοῖς ὕστερον μωρόςς and Chandler, Greek Accentuation, § 404 (2nd ed.). 408 δίπαλτος, in active sense (cp. ἄψαυστος ἔγχους, O. T. 9669 n), wieldin their swords with both hands, i.e., wit their utmost force. Eur. I. T. 323 ὡς τ εἴδομεν δίπαλτα πολεμίων ξίφη. That the word had passed into a figurative sense (in which διιwas merely equiv. to ‘fiercely ’), is indicated by τριπάλτων πημάτων in Aesch. Th. 985, woes hurled on one with crushing force. δίπαλτος should not be exvlained with ref. to the two spears of the Homeric warrior (Il. 5. 495 πάλλων δ’ ὀξέα δοῦρε). 411 φωνεῖν, exclamatory: Aesch. Eum. 837 ἐμὲ παθεῖν τάδε. It was common in colloquial Attic ; see e.g. Ar. Vesp. 835 βάλλ' ἐς κόρακας· τοιουτονὶπ τρέφειν κύνα. For this inf. with the article added, see Ph. 234 φεῦ τὸ καὶ λαβεῖν (d..—ἔτλη, of what one brings oneself to do ; here, ‘deigned.’ Cp. 528, Tr. 158. 412 πόροι ἁλίρροθοι : probably ‘pathss or straits of the sounding sea,’ as in Aesch. Pers. 367 ἔκπλους φυλάσσειν καὶ πόρους ἁλιρρόθους: meaning here the waters of the Hellespont. His thought asses from those waters to the ντρα beside them, and thence to the neighbouring woodlands. For the form of the phrase, cp. O. C. 1062 ῥιμφαρμάτοις ..ἁμίλλαις. — The other version, ‘paths dy the sounding sea,’ is possible, but less probable. 413 νέμος, properly pasture simply ; but associated with trees in Il. 11. 480 ἐν νέμειὺ σκιερῷ (a phrase repeated in Anth. 7. 55). In the Lat. nemus the notion of 2 woodland’ is seen dominant. As I have noted in writing on the Troad elsewhere, ‘nearly all the plains and hills are more or less well-wooded.. Besides the valonia oak, the elm, willow, cypress and tamarisk shrub abound. Lotus, galingale, and reeds are still plentiful, as in Homeric days, about the streams in the Trojan plain.’ (Encyc. Brit., art. ‘Troad,’ vol. xxIIl. p. 578.) 414 πολὺν πολύν με κ.τ..λ. 2his order of words has the best authority, and is confirmed by the metre. Cp. 396.—δὴ merely emphasises δαρόν. 416 ἀμπνοὰς ἔχοντα = ἔμπνουν ὄντα. The proper sense of ἀναπνοή is (1) ‘recovery of breath’; or (2) = εὐσπνοή as opp. to ἐκπροώ, the drawing in -of breath. ere, however, it means merely πνοή, as =’the breath of life.’ Cp. Eur. Or. 421 μητρὸς οἴχονται πνοαί. 417 f. Σκαμάνδριοι.ῥοαί: cp. Il. 2. 467 ἐν λειμῶνι Σκαμανδρίῳ ἀν-θεμόεντι. The Scamander, still called the Mendere, is the most important river of the Troad. Rising in Ida, it flows through the central plain which now bears the name of the town Bairamitch, and thence passes northward into the plain of Troy. On the confines between the two plains, where the river winds in large curves through deep gorges in limestone rocks, its scenery is striking. From the south border of th Trojan plain to the Hellespont, the Mendere has a course of between seven and eight miles.

This vaunt of Ajax (modified only by the half-apologetic ἔπος ἐξερῶ μέγα) is epic in tone; thus Achilles says of himself (ll. 18. 105), τοῖος ἐὼν οἷος οὔτις Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνωων: Odysseus, (qd. 9. 19..) ὃς πᾶσι δόλοισιν | ἀνθρώποισι μέλω, καί μευ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει. Such a tone is better suited, indeed, to epos (in which speech is sometimes little more than audible thought) than to drama. But here, at least, as in the case of Heracles (Tr. 1101 f.), it has the excuse of being prompted by the anguish of a sudden overthrow. (Cp. n. on O. T. 8, where Oedipus speaks of himself as ὁ πᾶσι κλεινος.)

There can be little doubt that the οὔθ’ of the Mss. should be οὐδ’ here. In El. 1197 and 1412 L has οὔθ’, where οὐδ’ is right; as in O. C.9.096 μήθ’ instead of μηδ’., As to the conditions under which οὐ.. ουὔτες wa admitted in Attic poetry, see on Tr. 1058 f. ὅπως ἐῶ (subjunct.), the indirect form of the ‘deliberative πῶς ἐῶ ; (bhow am I to alloy..**]) Cp. 0. T, 1367 οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅπως σε φῶ βεβουλεῦσθαι καλῶς: Dem. or. 9 § 5 οὐκ ἔχω τί λέγω. 430b. ἂν ..ᾤεθ’, ‘could have thought’; cp. 119 τίς ἂν..ηὐρέθη; —ἐπώνυμον here goes closely with ξυνοίσειν, ‘w9ould agree so signitcantly’ with my woes. Hence in 914 he is called δυσώνυμος. For the verb, cp. Ar. Eq. 1232 καὶ μήν σ’ ἐλέγξαι βούλομαι τεκμηρίῳ, | εἴ τι ξυνοίσες τοῦ θεοῦ τοῖς θεσφάτοις, i.e., ‘agee’ with the description of the person mentioned in them. For the adj., cp. Od. 7. 54 'Ἀρήτη δ’ ὄνομ’ ἐστὶν ἐπώννυμον : ib. 19. 409 τῷ δ’ Ὀδυσεὺς ὄνομ’ ἔστω ἐπώνυμον : where in each case ἐπώνυμον means that the name is signitcant (the queen was the ‘desired one’; the child was to be ‘a man of wrath’). This usage of ἐπώνυμος, with ref. to the aptness of a name (or surname)), is different from that in which a person or thing is said to be ἐπώνυμός τινος, either as (1) being named from it, or (2) giving a name to it. Cp. 574. Pindar adovts the derivation of Ἄας from αἰετός: I. 5. 53 καί νιν ὄρνιχος φανέντος κέκλετ’ ἐπώνυμον εὐρυβίαν Αίαντα. This was the popular etymology (schol. Apoll. Rh. 1. 1289; schol. Theocr. 13. 37: Apollod. 3. 12§7). But the association of Αἴας with αἶ αἷ appears in the legend that a hyacinth (on whose petals the letters AI were supposed to be legible, Moschus 3. 6) sprang from the blood of Ajax, as it had sprung from that of Hyacinthus: Ov. Met. 13. 397 : Littera communis mediis pueroque viroque) Inscripta est foliis,; haec nominis (Ajax), illa querelae (the wail of Hyacinthus). So Odysseus was associated with ὀδύσσομαι (Od. 1. 62 τί νύ οἱ τόσον ὠδύσαο, Ζεῦ̀͂; imitated by Soph., fr. 880) : Pentheus, with πένθος (Eur. Bacch. 507): Polyneices, with νεῖκος (Aesch. 22. 577, etc., Soph. Ant. 11 ..: Meleager, with μελέα ἄγρα (Eur. fr. 517): Sidêro with σίδηρος (Soph. fr. 597: and Helen is ἑλέναυς, etc. (Aesch. Ag. 6899). Such play on names did not seem to the Greeks unworthy of grave poetry, because to them the omens conveyed by wordsl(ὀμφαί, κληδόνες) were so serious. In modern poetry, too, it has sometimes been used with tragic pathos. Thus Dante Purg. XIII. 109 Savia non fui, avvegna che Sapiea Fossi chiamata: and Shakesp. Rich. II. act 2 sc. 1. 73 (Gaunt)) 0 hov that name beſits my composition!| Old Gaunt indeed; and gaunt in being old etc. The king asks, Can sice men play so nicely with their names72 No, is the reply, misey makes sport to mock itself. The real etymology of Αἴας is uncertain. Vase-inscriptions show that the original form was Αἴεας, and Sonne (in Kuhn’s Zeitschr. 10 p. 126) compares Indog. aiva, Skr. eva (‘course)-a derivation which Brugmann approves (Stud. 2. griech. u. lat. Gramm. 4. 180)). The sense, ‘swift runner,’ would suit Οιλῆος ταχὺς Αἴας better than the son of Telamon: and it is not improbable (as Fleischer suggests in Roscher's Lex. p. 139) that the names of the two heroes, though identical in form, were of distinct origin. 132 f. καὶ δὶς..καὶ τρίς: cp. Ph. 1238 δὶς ταὐτὰ βούλει καὶ τρὶς ἀναπολεῖν μ ἔπη;—τοιούτους γὰρ : for γάρ in two successive sentences, cp. 186. 14f. πατὴρ : Telamon, whom Heracles brought with him to the war at Troy, as Pindar relates (Tsthm. 5. 27 f., and rewarded with the hand of Hesionè (130 ff..—τὰ πρῶτα καλλιστεῖ' ἀριστεύσας, a free poetical mode of saying, ‘having won by prowess the first meed of honour.’ The word καλλιστεῖα (properly ‘prize for beauty ’) may have been chosen because the prize was Hesione,. Cp. 130 στρατοῦ τὰ πρῶτ’ ἀριστεύσας. 157 f. τόπον Τροίας, i.e. Τροίαν: a eriphrasis like τὸν Κιθαιρῶνος τόπον O. T. 1134). Here Τροία is used in the Homeric manner, to denote not only the city but the country; ἡ Τρῳᾴ, as =fthe Troad,’ occurs first in Herodotus (5. 122). —ἐπελθὼν, after Telamon; cp. ἐπιγίγνομι-. 159 ἀρκέσας has. here (though not elsewhere a sense which ἐπαρκεῖν with acc. often bears, viz., ‘to furnish at need’: Aesch. Ag. 1170 ἄκος δ’ οὐδὲν ἐπήρκεσαν. The strict meaning is then, “having rendered no less service by the deeds of my hand. 441-444 τοσοῦτόν γ' ἐξεπίστασθαι: cp. O. T. καίτοι τοσοῦτόν γ’ οἶδα (and l. 332). Her. 7. 152 ἐπίσταμαι δὲ τοσοῦτο, ὅτι κ.τ.λ. Here the omission of ὅτι adds vigour to εἰ ζῶν κ.κτ.λ. εἰ.. κρίνειν ἔμελλε, ‘if he iad been going to award.,’ ‘if it had devolved upon him to award.’ The imperfect (here referring to an unreal condition in past, not in present, time) is rightly used, because it expresses the constraint of a supposed situation. But in the apodosis, the aor., οὐκ ἄν τις ἔμαρψεν, is used, because the taking of the prize is an act done at a2. given moment. ὅπλων τῶν ὧν πέρι, i.e. in a case where they were the prize. Sophocles has ὅς, sus, (epic ἑος.) in OV. B. 1248 (οἶσιν), O. C. 1639 and Tr. 266 (ὀ͂ν), ib. 525 (ὅν). Here it is emphatic: ‘his own arms,’—of which he could dispose with the best right. κρίνειν .. κράτος ἀριστείας, to award the first place for prowess ; cp. Pind. I. 7. 5 ἀέθλων . . κράτος, victory in them. For the pres. inf. κρίνεν with ἔμελλε, cp. O. C. 1774 . ἔμαρψεν, praeripuisset; the prize due to Ajax was snatched from him.—ἀντ' ἐμοῦ: so Aesch. P. V. 467 οὔτις ἄλλος ἀντ’ ἐμοῦ. 445 f. νῦν δ', with ref. to a past moment ('but as it was’); so in 450, Tr. 8, El. 1334.—παντουργῷ occurs only here as = πανούργῳ: cp. παντότολμος as = πάντολμος. Cp. Aesch. Th. 671 φωτὶ παντόλμῳ φρένας. ἔπραξαν. Though πράσσειν offt. denotes intrigue (O. T. 125), the phrase πράσσειν τί τινι (Ato procure a thing for one by intrigue ’: is peculiar. Cp. Plut. Pomp. 51 πράττειν μὲν ἑαυτοῖς ἐπαρχιῶν καὶ στρα· τοπέδων ἡγεμονίας.ἀπώσαντες, ‘having thrust out of account,’ = ἀτιμάσαντες. The midd. is usual as =‘to reject’ (Tr. 216 ; but the act. here is not a mere equivalent for it.—κράτη : cp. El. 689 οὐκ οἶδα τοιοῦδ’ ἀνδρὸς ἔργα καὶ κράτη. 147 f. τόδ’ ὄμμα : some force and athos are lost by reading τό τ’ ὄμμα withh χϊ). . Cp. Athena's words ((531) δυσφόρους ἐπ’ ὄμμασι | γνώμας βαλοῦσα. διάστροφοι Aesch. P. V. 673 (Io speaking of herself εὐθὺς δὲ μορφὴ καὶ φρένες διάστροφοι | ἦσαν.-τῆς ἐμῆς is emphatic: my true purpose : so 100 τἄμ': 442 τῶν ων. οὐκ ἄν ποτε .. ἐψήφισαν: i:.h., they would have died before they could repeat such a villainy. See on v. 100, θανόντες . . ἀφαιρείσθων. The midd. ψηφίζομαι δίκην means ‘to decide a cause by one’s vote’; Isae. or. 3 § 7 τοῖς περὶ αὐτοῦ τούτου τὴν δίκη μέλλουσι ψηφιεῖσθαι. And for κατ’ ἄλλου φωτὸς cp. Plat. Gorg. p. 515 E oοὐδεμίαν αἰσχρὰν δίκην κατεψηφίσαντο αὐτοῦ. The act. ψηφίζω usu. ='to count' (as Polyb. 5. 26 κατὰ τὴν τοῦ ψηφίζοντος βούλησιν, ‘at the reckoner's will’). Here, δίκην ἐψήφισαν has the general sense of δίκην ἐψηφίσαντο: but it is not directly modelled on that prose idiom ; rather it is a new poetical phrase, meaning strictly, ‘get a cause decided by ψῆφοι.’ It implies that the votes against Ajax were secured by the intrigues of the chiefs : cp. Pind. N. 8. 26 f. κρυφίαισι γὰρ ἐν ψάφοις Ὁδυσσῆ Δαναοὶ θεράπευσαν · | χρυσέων δ’ Αἴας στερηθεὶς ὅπλων φόνῳ πάλαισεν. Αἐψή· φισαν certainly has not the technical sense of ἐεψήφισαν, as if the Atreidae were the ἡγεμόνες δικαστηρίου, who put the issue to the vote. Even if the simple ψηφίζω could be so used, this would be too technical and prosaic.] .450 ἡ Διὸς . θει) : cp. 401.-γοργῶπις, as in fr. 760. 2 the poet calls her τὴν Διὸς γοργῶπιν Ἐργάνην. Cp. Il. 1. 199, where Athena appears to Achilles : αὐτίκα δ' ἔγνω | Παλλάδ’ Ἀθηναίην· δεινὼ δέ οἰ ὄσσε φάανθεν.—ἀδάματος is the form required by metre in O. T. 205, 1315, and O. C. 1572; though in all three passages L gives the epic form ἀδάμαστος. 451 ἐπεντύνοντ', making ready: schol. εὐτρεπίζοντα. Il. 8. 374 ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν νῶιν ἐπέντυε μώνυχας ἵππους. Oppian Hal. 5. 56 ἥδη γὰρ δελφῖσιν ἐπεντύνουσιν *Ἄρηε.—The reading ἐπευθύνοντ’ seems less fitting in reference to the purposwhich the goddess foiled. It rather pictures him as already in the act of stretching forth his hand against his foes. But Athena had not suffered him to arrive in their presence; he had only reached their doors (49). If, however, ἐπευθύνοντ' is to mean merely, ‘preparing for use against them. ’ then it is decidedly less vivid than ἐπεντύνοντ’. The chief recommendation of ἐπευθύνοντ' is the fact that it was first written by the scribe of L, though corrected either by him or by an early hand. But (since εὐθύνω waas s familiar) it may easily have been a mere slip for the rarer and more exquisite word ἐπεντύνοτ'. 452 λυσσώδη νόσον: cp. 59: fr. 855. 4 λύσσα μαινάς. In Il. 13. 53 Hector is λυσσώδης, φλογὶ εἴκελος. 154 ἐπεγγελῶσιν. A compound used in Attic prose, but otherwise peculiar to this play ; it recurs in v. 969, 989. 455 f. ἐμοῦ μὲν : the particle merel emphasises the pron. : cp. 121 n.—βλάπτοι : cp. El. 696 ὅταν δέ τις θεῶν | βλάπτῃ, δύναιτ’ ἀν οὐδ’ ἂν ἰσχύων φυγεῖν (n.8. 457 X. ὅστις, causal. It is needless to read δρᾶν μ'. See on O.

has the general sense of δίκην ἐψηφίσαντο: but it is not directly modelled on that prose idiom ; rather it is a new poetical phrase, meaning strictly, ‘get a cause decided by ψῆφοι.’ It implies that the votes against Ajax were secured by the intrigues of the chiefs : cp. Pind. N. 8. 26 f. κρυφίαισι γὰρ ἐν ψάφοις Ὁδυσσῆ Δαναοὶ θεράπευσαν · | χρυσέων δ' Αἴας στερηθεὶς ὅπλων φνόνῳ πάλαισεν. Ιἐψήφισαν certainly has not the technical sense of ἐπεψήφισαν, as if the Atreidae were the ἡγεμόνες δικαστηρίου, who put the issue to the vote. Even if the simple ψηφίζω could be so used, this would be too technical and prosaic..] 450 ἡ Διὸς.. θεd : cp. 401.—γοργῶπις, as in fr. 760. 2 the poet calls her τὴν Ειὸς γοργῶπιν Ἐργάνην. Cp. Il. 1. 199, where Athena appears to Achilles : αὐπίκα δ' ἔγνω Παλλάδ’ Ἀθηναίην· δεινὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε φάανθεν.—ἀδάματος is the form required by metre in O. T. 205, 1315, and O. C. 1572; though in all three passages L gives the epic form ἀδάμαστος. 451 ἐπεντύνοντ', making ready: schol. εὐτρεπίζοντα. Il. 8. 374 ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν νῶιν ἐπέντυε μώνυχας ἵππους. Oppian Hal. 5. 56 ἥδη γὰρ δελφῖσιν ἐπεντύνουσιν Ἄρηε.—The reading ἐπευθύνοντ’ seems less fitting in reference to the purposewhich the goddess foiled. It rather pictures him as already in the act of stretching forth his hand against his foes. But Athena had not suffered him to arrive in their presence ; he had only reached their doors (49). If, however, ἐπευθύνοντ' is to mean merely, ‘preparing for use against them,’ then it is decidedly less vivid than ἐπεντύνονντ'. Tte chief recommendation of ἐπεθύνοντ' is the fact that it was first written by the scribe of L, though corrected either by him or b an early hand. But (since εὐθύνω was so familiar) it may easily have been a mere slip for the rarer and more exquisite word ἐπεντύνοντ'. 452 λυσσώδη νόσον: cp. 59: fr. 855. 4 λύσσα μαινάς. In Il. 13. 53 Hector is λυσσώδης, φλογὶ εἴκελος. 154 ἐπεγγελῶσιν. A compound used in Attic prose, but otherwise peculiar to this play; it recurs in v. 969, 989. 455 f. ἐμοῦ μὲν : the particle merel emphasises the pron.: cp. 121 n.—βλάπτοι : cp. El. 696 ὅταν δέ τις θεῶν | βλάπτῃ, δύναιτ’ ἂν οὐδ' ἂν ἰσχύων φυγεῖν (n..8. 457 x. ὅστις, causal. It is needless to read δρᾶν μ’. See on O.

Med. 52 πῶς σοῦ μόνη Μήδεια λείπεσθαι θέλει; Cp. Il. 9. 437, where Phoenix imagines himself remaining with the army at Troy after Achilles has gone home,—πῶς ἂν ἔπειτ’ ἀπὸ σεῖο, φίλον τέκος, αὖθι λιποίμην |ὀῖος; 162 καὶ ποῖον.; for καί in questions, cp. O. C. 263 (n.), El. 236.—ὄμμα : so . T. 1371 ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐκ οἶδ' ὄμμασιν ποίοις βλέπων | πατέρα ποτ’ ἂν προσεῖδον: Ph. 110 πῶς οὖν βλέπων τις ταῦτα τολμήσει λακεῖν; 464 f. γυμνὸν is defined by τῶν ἀριστείων ἄτερ: cp. Ph. 31 κενὴν οἴκησιν ἀνθρώπων δίχα: O. T. 57 ἔρημος ἀνδρῶν μὴ ξυνοικούντων ἔσω : Ant. 445 ἔξω βαρείας αἰτίας ἐλεύθερον. aὧν.. εὐκλείας στέφάνον (za glory-crown of which..): both genitives define the quality of the στέφανος, but εὐκλείας goes more closely with it: cp. 308 f. ἐρειπίοις | νεκρῶν ..ἀρνείου φόνου. 466 f.. ἀλλὰ δῆτν, introducing another alternative, as in El. 53 (n..)—ἔρυμα, their city-wall; cp. Her. 7. 223 τὸ ἔρυμα τοῦ τείχεος. — μόνος μόνοις: for the doubled adj., see on 267. The point of μόνοις is that the Trojans will not have their attention distracted by any other Greek foe. The phrase is thus an expression of the warrior’ proud self-reliance (cp. 423 f.): it is marred by reading πολλοῖς μόνος (cr. n.). δρῶν τι χρηστόν: for the order of words, cp. Ar. Ach. 128 ἀλλ' ἐργάσομαί τι δεινὸν ἔργον καὶ μέγα. The sense of δρᾶν τι alone is often similar : El. 305n. The pres. part., not δράσας, because he would die in the act.—There was a legend, which the poet glances at here, that Ajax, in his madness, attacked the Trojans with success; manu restituit praelium inssaniens (Cic. Tusc. 4. 23); and that his death was caused by an arrow from the bow of Paris: see n. on the Argument to the play, line 33. 460 Ἄτρείδας ... εὐφράναιμί που. Verg. Aen. 2. 104 Hoc Ithacus elit et magno mercentur Atreidae. 470 οὐκ ἔστι ταῦτα, as in Tr. 449: but οὐκ ἔστι simply, ib. 709, Ant. 289, El. 48. 471 f. δηλώσω...γεγώς: cp. Thuc. 1. 21 § 2 δηλώσει . ... μείζων γεγενημένος ς: Andoc. or. 4 5 14 ἐδήλωσε τῶν νόμων καταφρονῶν—μή τοι φύσιν γ': for μή τοι...γε, see on El. 518. τοι ("at any rate’, Lat. sane) limits, while γε emphasises the word which it follows. Note that οὔ τοι could be used here, if the result were viewed simply as a fact; O. C. 1353 (ἀκούσα)) τοιαῦθ’ ἁ τὸν τοῦδ’ οὔ ποτ’ εὐφρανεῖ βίον. But μή τοι is used, because the result is viewed as an aim; i.e., the relative clause is virtually a final clause : cp. Isocr. or. 1I 5 49 τοιαῦτα Τζητήσεις λέγειν, ἐξ ὧν μήτ’ αὐτὸς χείρων εἶναι δόξεις μήτε τοὺς μιμουμένους λυμανεῖ μήτε τὴν περὶ τοὺς λόγους παίδευσιν διαβαλεῖς.—ἄσπλαγχνος, only here in this sense; but cp. κακόσπλαγχνος (Aeesch. Th. 237), θρασύσπλαγχνο: and εὐσπλαγχγίά [Eur.] Rhes. 192. 473 f. τοῦ μακροῦ .βίου, i.., the normal span of life; cp. O. T. 518 οὕτοι βίου μοι τοῦ μακραίωνος πόθος. κακοῖσιν ..μηδὲν ἐξαλλάσσεται, Aids no variation in respect to his woes ; for the dat. cp. O. T. 25 φθίνουσα μὲν κάλυξιν : Xen. Cyr. 4. 1. 8 διεφθάρθαι.. ταῖς γνώμαις. The generic negative μηδὲν is used, because ὅστις refers to a class or type. (Cp. Aut. 178 f. ὅστις.. μὴ .. ἄπτεται..) For the sentiment, cp. Ant. 463 ὅστις γὰρ ἐν πολλοῖσιν, ὡς ἐγώ, κακοῖς ζῇ, πῶς ὅδ' οὐχὶ κατθανὼν κέρδος φέρει ; fr. 866 ὅστις γὰρ ἐν κακοῖσιν ἰμείρει βίου,| ἢ δειλός ἐστιν ἢ δυσάλγητος φρένας. 475 f. παρ' ἧμαρ ἡμέρα, 2the successive’ (not, ‘alternate’) ‘days’: the series formed by placing each new day at the side of its predecessors, as ἀνὴρ παρ' ἄνδρα could be said of forming men in rank. The sense is: *When a man's miseries are unbroken, τί τέρπειν ἔχει ἡμέρα παρ' ἦμαρ, what power to please him has each successive day, προσθείσα ((αὐτὸν τῷ κατθανεῖν, when it has brought him close up to death, καναθεῖσα τοῦ κατθανεῖν, and then again moved him back from death? Death is the boundary-line (γραμμή) on the field of life: Eur. El. 955 πρὶν ἂν πέλας | γραμμῆς ἵκηται καὶ τέλος κάμψῃ βίου (mors altima linea rerum). The man who is captive to evil fortune is like a πεσσός on the draughtboard, at one moment moved close up to the line, and then again withdrawn from it a little; but it is death, after all,—death and nothing else,—that awaits him (τοῦ γε κατθανεῖν). This is not the platitude, ‘all men must die’, but a thought suggested by the case of the man ‘whose woes are unvarying.’ Life has nothing in store for him; the question is mere whether he is to die at once, or to have a short and wretched reprieve. This is brought out by v. 479: καλῶς ζῆν is denied to him; and that being so, the next best thing is to die honourably and quickly-καλῶς τεθνηκέναι.

The phrase means simply, ‘a fortune imposed tby ἀνάγκη, z— by necessity, fate ; but it has different shade of meaning according to the context. Here, it is the fortune by which ἀνάγκη has dormed her to be a slave; but there is no direct reference to slavery in the words. Cp. 803. In El. 48 ἄναγκαίας τύχης is the ‘fatal chance ’ by which Orestes was killed. In Il 16. 836 ἦμαρ ἀναγκαῖον is ‘the day of doom’ hanging over Troy. 498 εἴπερ τινὸς σθένοντος, = σθένοντος, εἴ τις ἔσθενε: cp. O. C. 733 πρὸς πόλιν δ’ ἐπίσταμαι | σθένουσαν ἥκων, εἴ τιν' Ἑλ· λάδος, μέγα (n.).—ἐν πλούτῳ, lit, amid wealth; i.r., the phrase ='trong aand rich,’ rather than, ‘strong in riches.’ Cp. Aesch. Eum. 996 χαίρετ’ ἑν αἰσιμίαισι πλούτου. 480r. θεοῖς: for the synizesis, cp. 1129: El. 1264 n.—μάλιστα: i.e. as the immediate and visible agent of the gods. 400 f. τοιγαροῦν, 'So then’—marking that she turns away from the mournfu! past.-— τὸ σὸν λέχος ξυνῆλθον: λέχος is acc., as aſter a verb of motion : Eur. Phoen. 817 ἡ δὲ ξύναιμον λέχος ἦλθεν. (In Tr. 28 λέχος is rather nom., ‘as bride’.) —τὰ σά, acc. of respect, instead of σοι. 402 ἐφεστίου Διὸς, the god of the domestic ἐστία. In Her. I. 44 the Ἐπίστιος Ζεύς is the god who punishes a wrong done to the hearth by an abuse of hospitality. Cp. Eustath. p. 1930. 28 ἐν τῇ κατ’ οἶκον ἑστίᾳ Δι ἐγίνοντο θυσίαι, ὃν οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι ἐφέστιον, Ἡρόδοτος δὲ Ἰωνικῶς λέγει ἐπίστιον. 400 συνηλλάχθης: cp. Eur.

The reason for preferring Bothe' ᾗ to εἰ is that it brings out her thought with greater 6 force: the last day of his life will be the first of her misery. There is no objection to εἰ with the subjunctive, even in trimeters; cp. [O. C. 1443](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18618577) εἴ σου στερηθῶ, and see [O.

The reference of πικρὸν is not only to the scornful word ὁμευνέτιν, but also to οἵας λατρείας κ.τ.λ. λόγοις ἰάπτων, lit. 'shooting with words,’—launching taunts like missiles. The instrum. dat. λόγος marks the figurative sense of ἰάπτων, just as τόξοις defines its literal sense in [Aesch. Ag. 510](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0085.tlg005:510) (τόξοις ἰάπτων μηκέτ’ εἰς ἡμᾶς βέλη): the object answering to the literal βέλη (such as ὀνείδη) is left to be understood. Cp. [Rhianus](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2319055) (3rd cent. B.c..) ap.

This seems truer than to suppose that the constr. is λόγοις ἰάπτων (με), ‘assailing me with taunts,’ though the latter view might be supported by the rare use of ἴάλλω in [Od. 13. 142](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:13.142) πρεσβύτατον καὶ ἄριστον ἀτιμίῃσιν ἰάλλειν. s to the root of ἰάπτω, Curtius holds that ἰα·π is expanded from lα ( = Skt. ja, ‘go’), in a causative sense, by the determinative π, just as the Lat. ba-r is by X. (Greck Verb, p. 167 Eng. ed.) Cp. 700.

the nurture suitable to the young: O. C. 345 ἐξ ὅτου νέας | τροφῆς ἔληξε (n.). διοίσεται, sc. βίον, ‘pass his life’: schol. διάξει, βιώσεται. The midd. has this absolute sense in Hippocr. De artic. p. 823 ὑγιηροὶ τἄλλα..διαφέρονται (they pass through life’̀: : Xen. Mem. 2. 1. 24 σκοπούμενος διοίσει (a correction of διέσῃ). We find also διαφέρειν βίον or αἰῶνα (Her. 3. 40, Eur. Hele. 10), or διαφέρειν on ((2Eur.] Rhes. 982).—Others explain διοίσεται as pass., dirioietur, ‘(if) he shall be plundered.’ /n this sense the usual word is διαφορεῖν, though Eur. Bacch. 754 has διέφερον in a kindred sense, and Arist. Poet. 8 § 4 the pass. διαφέρεσθαι: but such a meaning, which would fix attention on the boy’s property, is utterly out of place here. [Lobeck, and Blaydes after him, cite Dion or. 41 p. 506 c ὑπ’ ὀρφανιστῶν διασπασθήσεται: but the correct reference is or. 43 p. 506 c, and the words, ὑπὸ τῶν συγγενῶν καὶ ἐπιτρόπων διασπασθῆναι.σοῦ.. μόνος: cp. O. C. 1250 ἀνδρῶν γε μοῦνος: Eur. Med. 52 σοῦ μόνη. 512 ὑπ' ὀρφανιστῶν (διοίσεται), if he shall have his life controlled by them : cp. ὑπό with the midd. πορεύεται in 1253 f.· O. C. 681 θάλλει δ’.. ὑπ’ ἄχνας. The sense is not merely, ‘live under them,’ as if ὑπό with the genitive here took the sense of ὑπό with the dative (sulditus illorum imperio, Ellendt). The word ὀρφανιστής (found only here) = ἐπίτροπος, ‘guardian.’ Eustathius (p. 533. 30), on Il. 5. 158 χηρωσταὶ δὲ διὰ κτῆσιν δατέοντο, explains χηρωσταί as those who administered the property of persons who left no direct heirs (τοὺς χηρεύοντας διαδόχων); adding, οἵτινες κατὰ λόγον ἄλλον καὶ ὀρφανιστὶ ἐκαλοῦντο, ὡς ὀρφανῶν ὑπεριστάμενοι, καθὰ καὶ Σοφοκλῆς δηλοῖ. Apparently, then, he knew the word only from this verse. (The verb ὀρφανίζω usu. =to make ὀρφανός). μὴ φίλων (the generic μή), of no friendlly kind; ſor the order, cp. Aesch. Eum. 903 ὁποῖα νίκης μὴ κακῆς ἐπίσκοπα. [The μὴ could also be explained by εἰ in 513: but this is less simple.] Compare Andromachè’s description, in her lament over Hector, of the lot in store for her chld, ἧμαρ δ’ ὀρφανικὸν παναφήλικα παῖδα τίθησιν, ‘the day of orphanhood makes a child companionless, ’ etc.: Il. 22. 490-498. 514 f. βλέπω, pres. pubjunct.: this is the indirect form of εἰς τί βλέπω; Cp. 428 ἐῶ (n)..—ἤυστωσας. There is no other certain instance of ᾀστόω for άἱστόω. (In fr. 493, κόρον ἀἱστώσας πυρί, Kuster’s conjecture κηρὸν, if right, would point to ᾀστώσας.) The ordinary form occurs i Tr. 81 αὑτὴν διιἵστωσε.—δορί. As to this form versus δόρει, see on O. C. 1304. 516 ἄλλη μοῖρα. Destiny, working through Ajax, ravaged her coucty. Destiny in some other form brought her father and mother to the grave. The poet did not wish to represent Tecmessa as living with the man who had slain her parents; and so followed, or invented, a legend which ascribed their deaths to a different agency. Throughout this speech, the Homeric scene between Hector and Andromachè is present to the mind of Sophocles. Andromachè's ſather had been slain by Achilles; her mother, by the visitation of Artemis (Il. 6. 414-428). 517 καθεῖλεν .. οἰκήτορας (proleptic), brought them low, so that they should be dwellers, etc. After ΑΑιδου, θανασί is redundant; but cp. Tr. 1161 ἀλλ' ὅστις ᾌδου φθίμενος οἰκήτωρ πέλοι : though ib. 282 we have simply, Ἄιδου πάντες εἴσ’ οἰκήτορες. For θανάσιμος said of the dead, cp. O. T. 959, Ph. 819. 518 πατρίς; Cp. Xen. An. 1. 3 5 6 νομίζω γὰρ ὑμᾶς ἐμοὶ εἶναι καὶ πατρίδα καὶ φίλους καὶ συμμάχους. ἐν σοὶ.. σσῴζομαι: cp. O. T. 314 ἐν σοὶ γὰρ ἐσμέν (n.). The prep. expresses that her safety is in his ppower,—depends on him. πᾶσ', adverbial: cp. 275. 520 f. κἀμοῦ: as well as of his parents and his son.—προσεῖναι, of a quality or attribute; cp. 1079, Ant. 720. —τερπνὸν εἴ τί που πάθοι: cp. Dido’s words to Aeneas (Aen. 4. 316 ff..) Per conubia nostra, per inceptos hymenaeos, | Si bene quid de te merui, fuit aut tibi quiquam | Dulce meum, miserere. For the optat., marking the generality of the statement, cp. 1344: Ant. 666 ἀλλ'' ὃν πόλις στήσειε, τοῦδε χρὴ κλύειν (c... 522 χάρις χάριν γάρ: Eur. Helen. 1234 χάρις γὰρ ἀτὶ χάριτος ἐλθέτω.For the place of γάρ, cp. Aesch. P. V. 29 θεὸς θεῶν γάρ κ.τ.λ: for that of the art., O. T. 1309 ἐκεῖνον ὁ κτανών.—τίκτουσ' : cp. the proverb in Zenobius 3. 328 δίκη δίκην ἔτικτε καὶ βλάβη βλάβην. 526f. ἀπορρεῖ: cp. 1267 : El. 100o n. -γένοιιτ-, cannot ‘become’ such, in the sense, ‘cannot finally be ranked as such.’ Whatever his other merits may be, their sum will not amount to true nobleness. 525 f. ἔχειν σ’ ἂν.. θέλοιμ’ ἄν: the first ἄν, as well as the second, belongs to θέλοιμι: cp. 537: O. T. 39 n.—ὡς κγὼ, sc. ἔχω. Cp. Il. 6. 476 δότε δὴ καὶ τόνδε γενέσθαι | παῖδ’ ἐμόν, ὡς καὶ ἐγώ περ, ἀριπρεπέα Τρώεσσιν: this also illustrates the use of καί, on which see O. C. 53 ὅσ οἶδα κἀγώ (n.. 527 f. καὶ κάρτ’. Here καὶz"’and.’ But where καὶ κάρτε replies to a question (O. C. 65 and 301), the verb being understood, καὶ merely emphasises (Yea, surely’)̀, and καὶ κάρτα is then equiv. to ἧ κάρτα (El. 312). Similarly in καιὶ μάλα, καὶ sometimes = ‘an'd,’ but sometimes merely strengthens the adv. (vel maxime): El. 1178 n. τὸ ταχθὲν =ἣ ἂν ταχθῇ: he has not yet given his command. Cp. Tr. 1187 ἦ μὴν ἐμοὶ τὸ λεχθὲν ἔργον ἐκτελεῖν, i.e. ὃ ἂν λεχθῇ —τολμᾷ, bring herself to do it: cp. 411: Ph. 481 τόλμησον, ‘make the effort.’ Instead of agreeing to take her advice (ἔπη), Ajax replies that he will be ready to praise her obedience. For the alliteration (παρήχησις) cp. 11 12: O. T. 371 τυφλὸς τά τ’ ὧτα τόν τε νοῦν τα τ’ ὄμματ’ εῖ (n.’. 520 ἀλλ’, in assent ; cp. Ph. 48 n. 550 ὡς ἴδω : cp. 538. The words express his impatient yearning. 581 καὶ μὴν φόβοισί γ'. The formula καὶ μήν (lit. ‘and verily ’) introduces a new fact or thought ; as in Tragedy it often announces a new comer (I168. When this new fact or thought raises a difficulty in the way of something proposed by the last speaker, then καὶ μήν acquires an adversative force. Thus here, its literal sense, ‘and verily,’ ‘indeed,’ is tinged by the context with the sense, ‘oh, but,’ or ‘nay, but.’ The ffect of γε is to place a slight stress on φόβοισι. The coanbination καὶ μήν...γε is very frequent with Sophocles: cp. 539: O. T. 290, 345, 836, 9887, 1004, 1066 : O. C. 396: Ant. 221 : Ph. 660: El. 1045, 118. In all these passages the tffect of γε is the same ; i.e., it does not modify the sense of καὶ μήν, but emphasises the word or phrase with which it is immediately connected. φόβοισι, causal dat.: the plur. as in O. T. 585 ξὺν φόβοισι. Her fears were indicated at v. 340.-ἐξελυσάμην, lit. ‘released’: i.e., allowed him to leave the tent. The midd. ἐκλύομαι means to '’release,’ ‘set free,’ in O. T. 1003, Ant. 1112, Tr. 21 : Xen. H.7. I. 255 ἐξελύσαντο τοὺς Ἀργείους. The choice of the word seems to be prompted by a wish not to saoymore than is implied in φόβοισι, or to imply that she had rescued the child from a danger. She speaks merely as if (in her undefined 'fears’) she had left the care of the child to others. Then the blunt and impatient question of Ajax—ἐν τοῖσδε τοῖς κακοῖσιν κ.τλ.—sartles her into speaking plainly, —μὴ σοί γέ που δύστηηνος κ.τ.λ. The conjecture ἐξερρυσάμην (cr. n.), ‘rescued,’ would efface this trait of reticence. It is inferred from the scholiast’s phrase, τῶν φόβων χαριν ῥύσασθαι θέλουσα ἐξήγαγον. But ἐξήγαγον is there the important word, while the words ῥύσασθαι θέλουσα are merely the scholiast’s expansion of the motive implied in φόβοισι. 52 κακοῖσιν: a half-euphemistic phrase, as in 272, 431, 433. 565 μὴ σοί γε κ.τ.λ. Here γε replies to his question (TYes, lest..’), and qualifies the whole sentence (cp. Ant. 648 n.) : but it also adds to the emvhasis on σοί. 554 πρέπον γέ τἂν ἦν. For γέ τοι cp. Ph. 823 n.—δαίμονος, fortune : El. 1306 τῷ παρόντι δαίμονι. A gen. after πρέπων is very rare, but analogous to the gen. after ἄξιος: Plat. Menex. p. 239 c πρεπόντως τῶν πραξάντων. [In Plat. Rep. p. 4000 B ὕβρεως ἢ μανίας καὶ ἄλλης κακίας πρέπουσαι βάσεις, the gen. seems to depend on πρέπουσαι : but might be possessive..] 585 ἀλλ' οὖν ("well, at any rate’), followed by γε (emphasising the word before it), occurs also in Ant. 84, Ph. 1305, El. 233, 1035, etc.—φύλαξα: cp. 308 'θώϋξεν.ἀρκέσαι, infin. of purpose : cp. O. T. 198 n. For the sense, defendere, cp. I1. 30. 296. ἡ κόρυθ’ ἠὲ σάκος, τό οι ἤρκεσε λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον : Eur. El. 1300 (πῶ) οὐκ ἠρκέσατον κῆρας μελάθροις; 556 ἐπῄͅνησ' : for the ao., cp. El. 66S e.̓́θου: cp. 13 n 557ὡς ἐκ τῶνδ': : i.e., seeing that the child has been sent away, and that Ajax approves of her precaution (536) She wishes to divert him from the desire of seeing his son. But he instantly recurs to it.—For ἐπ τῶδες,‘under these conditions, cp. Tr. 1100 (n.). ὡς gives a limiting force (as in ὡς ἐμοί, 395) : Eur. Andr. 1184 οὖτός τ’ ἂν ωὡς ἐκ τῶν. ἐτιμᾶτ’ ἄν, γέρον, | θανών. Thuc. 4. 17 § 1 ὡς ἐκ τῶν παρόντων. There is a verbal likeness to Ant. 552 τί δῆτ’ ἂν ἀλλὰ νῦν σ' ἔτ’ ὠφελοῖμ’ ἐγώ; 580 καὶ μὴν here announces a fact which favours the last speaker’s wish, and not, as in 531, a fact opposed to it; here, therefore, it becomes an expression of assent.—γ eemphasises πέλας.—vπροσπόλοις, dat. of agent; rare, except with the perf. pass. ; but cp. Ant. 1218 θεοῖσι κλέπτομαι, and ib. 504 f. (n.). 540 μὴ οὐ, since τί μέλλει is equiv. to μὴ μελλέτω : cp. Aesch. P. V.627 τί δῆτα μέλλεις μὴ οὐ γεγωνίσκειν τὸ πᾶν ;ς—παρουσίαν ἔχειν = παρεῖναι: a periphrasis like θήραν ἔχων (564), ἔχει στίβον (Ph. 157). 542 εὐθύνων: cp. Eur. Heracl. 728 εὐθύνων πόδα. 548 ἕρποντι φωνεῖς...; the partic. expresses the leading idea ; cp. O. C. 1038 χωρῶν ἀπείλει νῦν (n.).λελειμμένῳλόγων, unable to catch the sound of thy words ; schol. in L, οὐκ ἀκούοντι. Cp. Eur. Or. 1085 ἦ πολὺ λέλειψααι τῶν ἐμῶν βουλευμάτων (‘ laggest far behind them,’—failest to comprehend them): Helemd. 1246 λέλειμμαι τῶν ἐν Ἕλλησιν νόμων ("am not versed in them ). 544 καὶ δὴ, ‘already’: O. C. 31 n. 545 αἴος δεῦoo. The child is led in by an attendantt : Ajax means, ‘lift him ’ (from the ground) ‘to my arms.’ Some take αἶρε as ='bring,’ comparing Il. 6. 264 μή μοι οἶνον ἄειρε, Ar. Pax 11 αιἶρ’ αἶρε μᾶζαν ὡς τάχιστα κανθάρῳ : but this is less simple, and less fitting.—ταρβήσει γὰρ οὒ: for οὐ laced after the verb, see on Ant. 96. This passage recalls Il. 6. 466-470, where Hector is about to take his little son from the nurse’s arms, but the child shrinks back, frightened by the helmet,— ταρβήσας χαλκόν τε ἰδὲ λόφον ἱππιοχαιτην546 νεοσφαγῆ....φφόνον, the adj. compounded with a word akin in sense to the subst.; cp. Ant. 1283 νεοτόμοισι πλήγμασιν-——There is no reason to doubt the genuineness of που, which gives a touch of grim irony. L’s reading. τοοῦ, certainly ints to τοῦτόν γε: but this is very inerior to the vulgate. Wecklein, reading του, thinks that Ajax wishes to avoid saying κοὺ. 547 δικαίως, in a full and true sense : cp. O. T. 852 οὔτοι ποτ’, ὦναξ, τόν γε Λαῖου φόνον | φανεῖ δικαίως ὀρθοόν, i.e. “ properly fulfilled.z—τὰ πατρόθεν is redundant, but not pointless; the qualities derived from the father will prevail over any weaker qualities derived μητρόθεν. 548 f. ὡμοοῖς .. ἐν νόμοις, the rugged usages of a warrior inured to the sight of bloodshed. For the adj., cp. 205 ὠμοκρατής, n. In saying νόμοις rather than τρόποις, he speaks with a certain heroic grandeur (μεγαλοφρονῶν, as the schol. remarks). Cp. Hor. C. 2. 15. 11 non ita Romuli | Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis | Auspiciis veterumque norma. πωλοδαμνεῖν, to break him in like a colt. The word was familiar in Attic (Xen. Oec. 3. 10, etc.). Cp. Plut. Mor. 13 B οὔτω σκιρτῶσα νεότης πωλοδαμνεῖται. Lucian Amor. 45 τὴν νεότητα πωλοδαμνήσας. For the metaphor inplicit in the compound verb, cp. Ant. 94 ἐναυκλήρεις πόλιν. κἀξομοιοῦσθαι is passive, and αὐτόν (the object of πωλοδαμνεῖν) is its subject, ν being acc. of respect. For the infinitives, linked by καί, yet having different subjects, cp. Plat. Rep. p. 359 P (λέγουσιν) αὐτὸν ἀφανῆ γενέσθαι τοῖς παρακαθημένοις, καὶ διαλέγεσθαι [sc. αὐτοὺς ὡς περὶ οἰχομένου. 550b. ὧ παῖ κ.τ.λ. Paraphrased by Attius, Armorum Iudicium fr. 10, Virtuti sis par, dispar fotunis patris : and imitated by Verg. Aen. 12. 435 (Aeneas to Ascanius), Disce, puer, virtutem ex me verumque laborem, 1 Eortumam ex aliis. τὰ δ’ ἄλλ' ὅμοιος: so Hector prays for Astyanax that he may be like his father, ——ὧδε βίην τ’ ἀγαθὸν καὶ Ἰλίου ἶφι ἀνάσσειι: but adds the nobler prayer that men may say, πατρός γ’ ὅδε πολλὸν ἀμείνων. (Il. 6. 46 ff.) 552 ſ. καίτοι..καὶ νῦν : nay, euen noο—while that prayer still awaits fultlment—the child is happier than his father, in unconsciousness of evil.—σες is better here than σὲ (which L has), though the emphasis could be defended (I, the man, might envy thee, the child ’.)--τοῦτό γε: this acc. of respect (instead of the ordinary genitive) with ζηλοῦν is unusual; but the same constr. sometimes occurs with words of a like sense, e.g. Ar. Vesp. 588 τουτὶ γάρ τοί σε μόνον .. μακαρίζω. οὐδὲν is best taken as acc. governed by ἐπαισθάνει: cp. 996: O. T. 424 ἄλλων δὲ πλῆθος οὐκ ἐπαισθάνει κακῶνν. It might, however, be adv. (cp. Ant. 1183 τῶν λόγων ἐπῃσθόμην). 555 ἐν τῷ φρονεῖν μηδὲν: i.e., before there is any intelligent consciousness of joy or sorrow (555). 554 ἰ [τὸ μὴ φρονεῖν γὰρ κ.τ.λ.. Such an unconsciousness is an ‘evil,’ as excluding τὸ χαίρειν, but ‘painless,’ as exempt from τὸ λυπεῖσθαι. This verse was probably written in the margin, as a parallel passage to v. 554, and then crept into the text. It may come (as Valckenär thought) from some other play of Sophocles; its tone seems less sggestive of Euripides. That it was a familiar quotation, may be seen from the way in which it is brought in by the novelist Eustathius (o Eumathius), in τὸ καθ' Ὑσμίνην καὶ Ὑσμινίαν δρᾶμα (. 1100 A.D.8), ch. 2 8 7 (Erot. Scripitores vol. I1. p. 174 ed. Hercher), τοῦ ἔπους ἐμνήσθην ὡς τὸ μὴ φρονεῖν κάρτ’ ἀνώδυνον κακόν. It is translated, along with v. 53, in the sentences of Publilius Syrus c. 45 V.c.).), 876 f., Suavissima haec est vita, si sapias nihil: | am sapere nil doloris expers est malum. But those two verses are doubtless later intervolations in the text of Publilius : they are wanting in the best Ms. (Monac. lat. 6292). 555 ἕω, without ἄν: so Ph. 764, Tr. 148. 556 f. ἵκῃ πρὸς τοῦτο, i...e. πρὸς τὸ μαθεῖν. Cp. 1365..-δεῖ σ' ὅπως.δείξεις see on Ph. 54 f. τὴν Φιλοκτήτου σε δεῖ ψυχὴν ὅπως λόγοισιν ἐκκλέψεις λέγων.— ‘τράφης suggests the inbred qualities of the race; cp. Ph. 3 κρατίστου πατρὸς Ἑλλήνων τραφείς. For the prodelision of the augment in the 6th foot of the v., cp. Ant. 457 φάνη: Eur. Heln. 263 (ἐ[̓́θε)) αἴσχιον εἶδος ἀντὶ τοῦ καλοῦ Δλαβον. 558 τέως, ‘meanwhile,’ referring to the limit of time marked by v. 556.

Cp. Tr. 144 τὸ γὰρ νεάζον ἐν τοιοῖσδε βόσκεται χώροισιν αὐτοῦ etc. (n.). The word ἀτάλλω (which in Il. 13. 27 means 'to gambol') bears the sense of 'cherishingʼ in Hom. epigr. 4. 2 νήπιον αἰδοίης ἐπὶ γούνασι μητρὸς ἀτάλλων, and Pind. fr. 214 γλυκεῖά οἱ καρδίαν ἀτάλλοισα.. ἐλπίς. The Homeric form in this sense is ἀτιτάλλω, Od. 18. 323 παῖδα δὲ ὧς ἀτίταλλε. The word ἀτάλλω may have been suggested to Sophocles by a trait in the scene between Hector and Andromachè: Il. 6. 400 παῖδʼ ἐπὶ κόλπῳ ἔχουσʼ ἀταλάφρονα, νήπιον αὔτως.

clause to ἀγγείλατ’ ἐντολήν. A final clause, ὅπως... δείξῃ, would be less fitting here.Ἐριβοίᾳ λέγω. The dat. is more forcible than the acc. would be, as it keeps the command, ὅπως δείξει μητρί, before the mind; cp. Aesch. fr. 175 τῆς Ἀντικλείας ἆσσον ἦλθε Σίσυφος, | τῆς σῆς λέγω τοι μητρός. Dem. or. 19 § 152 περὶ . . μειζόνων, λέγω δὲ Φωκέων καὶ Πυλῶν. Ajax adds these words to show that he does not mean Teucer’s mother, Hesionè (130)). Eriboea was the daughter of Alcathoüs, king of Megara : Pindar mentions her as the mother of Ajax (I. 5. 45). She is called Periboea by Apollodorus (3. 12 § 7) and Pausanias (I. 42. 1). 571 μέχρις οὖ. This verse is doubt less due to an interpolator who wished to limit εἰσαεί. It has three marks of spuriousness. (11) μέχρι, not μέχρις, is the Attic form. (2) The anapaest in the first foot is a needless harshness, when either ἕως or ἔστ’ ἂν was available. (3) The division of an anapaest (in the first foot) bet ween two words has no Sophoclean paralltl except in Phil. 795 τὸν ἴσον χρόνον τρέφοιτε τήνδε τὴν νόσον: and the Philoctetes was one of the latest plays (409 B.c..)—It might be added that μυχοὺς κίχωσι is a somewhat strange phrase; though we may compare Il. 21. 128 ἄστυ κιχείομεν. The use of κίχω in 657 is slightly different. 572 ) μήτ'..θήσουσσ': depending on ὅπως in 567. Cp. Od. II. 546 (referring to the contest for the arms), ἔθηκε δὲ πότνια μήτηρ (Thetis), ‘offered them as a rize.z ἀγωνάρχαι (a word found only ere) = ἀγωνοθέται, the presidents of the games, such as the Amphictyons were at the Pythian festival. The presidents appointed the ἐπιμεληταί who actually supervised the contests, such as the "Eλλανοδίκαι at Olympia. (Cp. El. 690 n.) μήθ’ ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμόν. Only two parallels for the place of ἐμός are brought frm classical Greek literature. (1) Eur. Hipp. 683 ζεύς σ’ ὁ γεννήτωρ ἐμός: where G. Wolff would omit ὁ. (2) Theocr. 27. 58 τὠμπέχονον ποίησας ἐμὸν ῥάκος: where Schaefer’s remedy, ἐμοὶ, is quite admissible; Hermann wrote ἀμπεχόναν.. ἐμάν. The nearest analogy to such a license as ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμός is afforded by such instances as τὸν ἐμὸν πατέρ’ ἄθλιον (El. 133 n.), where ἄθλιον is a mere epitet, but ought, by position, to be a predicate. Remem bering the originally pronominal sense of the art., we may hesitate to affirm that an Attic poet could not have wentured to write ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμός, meaning, ‘that destrover of mine.’ o correction is very probable. We cannot read μήθ’ ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμοῦ, since, though μου can represent the possessive pron., such a use of ἐμοῦ would be unexampled. (See Krüger, Gr. Sprachlehre, § 479. 11.) The dat. ἐμοί is eo untenable. It is possible that the poet wrote μήτε λυμεὼν ἐμός: but the artícle, if not indispensable, is at least very desirable here. 574 αὐτό, that,—with an emphasis due to the place of the word.—ἐπώνυμον, ‘that gives thee thy name ’; as at Athens the ἑπώνυμοι were the heroes who gave names to the Attic tribes. Cp. 430 n. 579 f. πολυρράφου. .πόρπακος. This must be interpreted by the usage of the oet's day, not by. Homeric practice. te πόρπακ may be seen on shields depicted in Greek vase-paintings; an example is reproduced in Smith's Dict. of Antiquiities (3rd ed., vol. l. p. 459, art. clipeus). It was a leathern thong, running round the inner edge of the shield, and fixed at intervals of six inches or so by ins or nails, so as to form a succession of oops. The name, πόρπαξ, was derived from these pins (πόρπαι), which could be taken out, when it was wished to remove the πόρπαξ and so to unfit the shield for immediate use. (It is made a charge against Cleon in Ar. Eq. 849 that he had dedicated the shields taken at Pylos αὐτοῖσι τοῖς πόρπαξιν.) But a loop at the edge of the shield, such as the πόρπα offered to the warrior's hand (Eur. Helen. 1376 ἐμβαλὼν πόρπακι γενναίαν χέρα), would not suffice to give him control. Hence, in the vasepainting noticed above, we see the πόρπαξ combined with another contrivance, viz., a band (of metal, or wood), placed vertically across the inside of the shield, and furnished at the middle with an arrangement of small bars, forming a support for the arm just below the elbow. This band was the ὄχαννον or ὀχάνη..—See Appendix. πολυρράφου (' much, or well, stitched’) is a general epithet for elaborate leatherwork, and is again illustrated by the vase-painting cited above, where ornamental tassels hang from the pins which divide the loops of the πόρπαξ. In Theocr. 25. 265, πολύρραπτόν τε φαρέτρην, the epithet prob. refers to braiding ; quivers were often made of hide or eather. ἑπτάβοιον = epic ἑπταβόειον: see n. on 19. The second part of the compound is not βοῦς, but βοεία, ox-hide (Il. 12. 296). The shield was the work of Τυχίος, σκυυτοτόμων ὅχ’ ἄριστος,—so essentially was the currier's art that which it chiefly demanded (Il. 7. 220). Tychios dwelt at Ἕλη,—probably the Boeotian (Ill. 2. 500), The number of seven layers of hide was robably exceptional; in Il. 15. 479 eucer has a σάκος τετραθέλυμνον, i.e., with four such layers. 577 τεθάψεται. Here, as at 1141, the fut. perf, gives a peremptory tone. Athena uses it in Eur. I. T. 1464: οὗ καὶ τεθάψει. (Cp. Ar. Nub. 1436 τεθνήξει) The ordinary fut. pass. wa ταφήσομαι. The practice of burying a warrior’s arms with him was a primitive Aryan custom ; witness the swords found in the graves at Mycenae. Sophocles in this play ſollows the legend that the body of Ajax was interred, and not, as was the ordinary practice in the heroic age, burned (cp. 1166 n.). The reference to the burial of the arms is thus perfectly fiting. There was less meaning in the practice, noticed by Homer, of burning a warrior’s armour with him; Il. 6. 418 ἀλλ' ἄρα μιν κατέκη σὺν ἔντεσι δαιδαλέοισιν : Od. 11. 74 ἀλλά με κακκῆαι σὺν τεύχεσιν. It may have come down from the earlier days when interment was the rule. No arms are burned on the pyre of Patroclus (Il. 23. 165 ff.), Hector (24. 785 ff.), or Achilles (Od. 24. 65 ff). κοίν' ἐμοι: κοιναὶ i here adv.: cp. Ant. 546 μή μοι θάνῃ σὺ κοινά.

πακτόω (πακτός= πηκτός) is used by Her. 2. 96 in the compound ἐμ--, and by Ar. Vesp. 128, of ‘stopping up’ holes, ‘caulking,” eand this may have been its special sense. But the general sense, ‘to make fast,’ occurs in Ar. Lys. 264 μοχλοῖς τε καὶ κλῄθροισι τὰ προπύλαια πακτοῦν. Eustathius, who explains it by ἀσφαλίζεσθαι (p. 742. 43), seems to regard the use f the. word with ref. to closing doors as peculiarly Attic (p. 1937. 62 τὸ συγκλεῖσαι, πακτῶσαι παρ’ Ἀττικοῖς). According to Pollux 10. 27, however, Archilochus had used πακτῶσαι as = κλεῖσαι.

[Euripides](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48305) has what seems an echo of this verse in the [Hr. cules Furens](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1233835) (a play referable to 421— 416 B.C., and so later than the [Ajax),](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q412341) 1184 Θ. εὔφημα φώνει. ΑΑγΦ. βουλομένοισιν ἐπαγγέλλει. The division of the verse between two speakers (̓ντιλαβή) is here used for the rst time in the play, to mark the tension of feeling. 5 ξυνέρξεθ', =9συγκλείσετε, fut. of ξυείργω: but in [h. 1407](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006:1407) we find εἴρξω, a form which the poet may have preferred there, because in the verse before he had used ἔρξεις as fut. of ἔρδω. (In Tr. 83 ξυνέρξων is fut. of ξυνέρδω.) The command is given to the πρόσπολοι (544). 595 ἄρτι: i.e. this new hope (if such she has) is one of which long experience might have taught her the vanity. Ajax is now withdrawn into the tent on the eccyclema (εἰσκυκλεῖται), and the entrance is closed. Tecmessa and her child retire by another door into the part of the dwelling which is supposed to represent the γυναικών. They re-enter after the Choral ode, and are present while Ajax speaks (see 684 ff). Some, indeed, suppose that they remain on the scene during the ode; but the command of Ajax to Tecmessa in 579 f., μηδ’ ἐπισκήνους γόους | δάκρυε, is against this. Welcker thinks that not only Tecmessa (with the child), but Ajax also, remain present during the ode. (Rhein. MMus. for 1829, part 3, p. 8.) It is clear, however, from v. 593 that Ajax withdraws into the tent. 556-645 First stasimon. It strophe, 596-608= 1st antistr., 609— 621: 2nd str. 622—634 = 2nd ant. 635— 645. For the metres see Metrical Analvsis. 507 νναίεις : cp. Il. 2. 626 νήσων, αῗ ναίουσι πέρην ἁλός.—ἁλίπλακτος (πλήσσω), not ἁλίπλαγκτος (πλάζω), is right here; the latter has the better Ms. authority, but could mean only, ‘wandering on the sea,’ as in 695 Πὰν ἁλίπλαγκτε. Cp. Pind. P. 4. 14 τᾶσδ’ ἐξ ἁλιπλάκτου ... γᾶς (the island of Thera). Aesch. Pers. 307 θαλασσόπληκτον νῆσον Αἴαντος. πᾶσιν περίφαντος ἀί does not allude to the vitory at Salamis, but, for Athenian ears, would necessarily be tinged with the thought o it. 600 παλαιὸς ἀφ’ οὖ χρόνος: cp. Ph. 493 ὃν δὴ παλαιιὸν ἐξ ὅτου δέδοικ’ ἐγω | μή μοι βεβήκῃ (n.). 601-60 ἰδαῖα κ.τ.λ. If this passage cannot be restored with certainty, at least the doubt lies within narrow limits. Three voints should be noted. 1. The metre (logaoedic) is clear: no suspicion rests on the antistrophic verses, 613—615 κρατοῦντ’ ...ηὔρηται. Metre proves, then, that (a) instead of L's ιἰδαία, we require --, which is given by Ιδαῖα. () Instead of λειμωνίᾳ ποίᾳ we require — , which is satisfied by λειμώνι’ ἔπαυλα. (c) Instead of εὐνόμᾳ, we require-. 2. εὐνῶμαι, as a correction of εὐνόμᾳ, mav be regarded as certain. Sovhocles would have written EΥNOMAI. It is confirmed by the fact that our best Ms., L, has μίμνων, not μίμνω. 3. μηνῶν, as a correction of μήλων, is (to my mind) not less certain. For μηνῶν ἀνήριθμος, cp. Tr. 247 (χρόνον) ἡμερῶν ἀνήριθμον. In no other way can ἀνήριθμος be justified. What remains doubtful, then, is only how we should correct the words, ἰδαῖα. .. λειμωνίᾳ ποίᾳ. Νow, in favour of 'Ἰδαῖα . λειμώσ’ ἔπαυλα, let it be noted that, if ἔπαυλα was the genuine word, then the corruption of μηνῶν into μήλων is ah once explained ; for ἔπαυλα meant properly a fold for cattle, as in O. T. 1138, where it is synonymous with σταθμά. Here, however, it would have the general sense which it bears in O. C. 669, ἵκου τὰ κράτιστα γᾶς ἔαυλα, ‘dwellings, r—a sense in which σταθμά too was poetically used. No other conjecture accounts for the origin of μήλων. The construction then is, εὐνῶμαι Ἰδαῖα λειμώνια ἔπαυλα, ‘I am encamped in quarters on the fields of Ida,’ μηνῶν ἀνήριθμος, ‘through countless months. For the acc. with εὐνῶμαι, cp. such phrases as ζυγὸν ἔζομαι (20p n). κεῖμαιι τόπον (Ph. 144 f..). For εὐνῶμαι with ref. to camping, cp. Il. 10. 408 Τρώων φυλακαί τε καὶ εὐναί Aesch. Ag. 559 εὐναὶ γὰρ ἦσαν δαἵων πρὸς τείχεσιν· | ἐξ οὐρανοῦ δὲ κεπὸ γῆς λεειμώνιαι | δρόσοι κατεψάκαζον—a passagee which Sophocles may have had in mind. For other views of the passage, and other emendations, see Appendix. 605 χρόνῳ, notwithstanding χρόνος in 600. Tennyson's poem, The LotosEaters, begins thus —‘Courage I” he said, and pointed toward the land, | “This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon.” | In the afternoon they came unto a land 2 In which it seemed always afternoon.’ The repetition of the word• ’land’ there was deliberate, being designed to suggest languor. Sophocles doubtless had no such conscious aim here; he was simply indifferent, as so often, to the recurrence (0. C. 554 n.); but something of a like effect is actually produced. The conjecture πόνῳ for χρόνῳ is not probable. 606 ἐλπίδ', the neutral ‘expectation,' is here coloured by κακάν: below, in 1382, it stands alone as = a foreboding of evil: cp. 799 ἐλπίζει. 607 f. ἔτι : i.e., before the campaign is over. —με—2 though the pron. refers to the subject of the in.f: Tr. 706 n.— ἀνύσειν ..Αίδαν, as Eur. Suppl. 1142 ποτανοὶ δ’ ἤνυσαν τὸν Ἄινδαν. Cp. O. C. 1562 ἐξανύσαι τὰν παγκευθῆ κάτω | νεκρῶν πλάκα. But in Tr. 657 πρὸς πόλιν ἀνύσειε. τὸν ἀπότροπον, the god from whom mortals shrink in horror, ὂν ἀποτρέπονται: cp. O. T. 1313 lἰὼ σκότου | νέφος ἐμὸν ἀπότροπον (n.). αἰίδηλον Ἄιδαν: the etymology of Hades was so far forgotten in the personification that the tautology of this phrase would not be felt. Cp. Il. 2. 758 Πρόθοος θοὸς ἡγεμόνευεν. The Homeric sense of ἀΐδηλος is active, ‘destroying’ (ἀφαίζων): but Hes. Op. 754 has ἀιδηλα as ἀφανῆ. 610 ἔφεδρος was said of an athlete who ‘sat by’ at a match between two other men, prepared to engage the winner (cp. suppositicius in Mart. 5. 24. 8). Thus in Ran. 792 Sophocles proposes ἔφεδρος καθεδεῖσθαι, while the two oher poets contend, and to encounter Euripides if the latter should vanquish Aeschylus. To the Chorus (χρόνῳ τρυχό-μενος), Ajax is an ἔφεδρος, as being a fresh trouble in reserve. Schol.: πρὸς τοῖς πρώτοις κακοῖς ὥσπερ δεύτερόν ἐστί μοι κακὸν τὸ τοῦ Αἴαντος ξυνεστηκό; where the last word is happily chosen to mark that ἔφεδρος implies a trouble with which they have to grapple: see on O. C. 514 ἀλγηδόνος, ᾇ ξυνέστας. For the fig. sense, cp. Philo vol. 2 p. 527 μετὰ πάσας τὰς αἰκίας .. αὐτοῖς ἡ τελευταία καὶ ἔφεδρος τιμωρία σταυρὸς ἦν, ‘after all their torments, the final doom reserved for them was the cross.’ The technical sense of the word was so familiar (cp. Pind. N. 4. 96, Aesch. Cho. 866) that it would be understood here without direct help from the context. Prof. Campbell pronounces this interpretation ‘untenable,’ and renders ἔφεδρος ‘fixed at my side,’ because ‘Ajax had remained sitting throughout the previous scene,’ and had now apparently relapsed into sullen inaction within his tent. 611 θείᾳ, as in 186 θεία νόσος.— ξύναυλος (αὐλή), dwelling with: cp. O. 1205 f. ἄταιις. . ξύνοικος. 612 f. ἐξεπέμψω.θουρίῳ : a reminiscence of Aesch. Pers. 137 (ἑκάστα, each Persian wife) τὸν αἰχμάεντα θοῦρον εὐνατῆρα προπεμψαμένα: where, as here, the midd. = ‘from herself.’— πρὶν δή ποτε, ‘in some bygone day.’—Ἄρει with ά as in 254 (n.). 614 φρενὸς οἰοβώτας, ‘a lonely pasturer of his thoughts,’—i.h., one who nurses lonely thoughts. They allude to the gloomy and ominous despair which has replaced his frenzy. The ending -βώτης could mean either βοσκόμενος, as in Ph. 1148 οὐρεσιβώτας (θῆρας), or βόσκων. The latter seems best here ; his φρήν represents the flock; he is the shepherd. Cp. Aesch. Suppl. 304 ποῖον πανόπτην οἰοβουκόλον λέγεις; (Argus,— Io being his sole charge.) Simonides fr. 133Ὅσσα, Κιθαιρῶνός τ’ οἰονόμοι σκοπιαί. ther compounds in which οἷος has a like force are οἰόφρων (πέτρα, Aesch. Suppl. 795), οἰόζωνος (0. T. 846). 515 ὕρηται. ηύρημαι is usually pass; but sometimes mid.., as inDem. or. 19 § 17, or. 55 § 31, Aeschin. or. 3 § 162. Here the pass. sense is more forcible : Ajax is himself the πένθος. 616 f. ἔργα χεροῖ.. ἀρετᾶς, handdeeds of valour : both genitives define ἔργα, but χεροῖν belongs to it more closely : cp. 308 f. ἐρειπίοις 2 νεκρῶν ... φόνου. 620 f. ἄφιλα παρ’ ἀφίλοις: for the doubled adj., cp. 267 n. παρά with dat. = ‘in their estimation’: Tr. 589 δοκεῖς παρ’ ἡμῖν οὐ βεβουλεῦσθαι κακῶς: Dem. or. 2 § 3 θαυμαστότερος παρὰ πᾶσι νομίΔεται.—ἄφιλα ...ἔπεσε, have fallen, have turned out, so as to win no kindness. The adj. is proleptic: ἔπεσε is a metaphor from dice: cp. Pind. O. 12. 10 πολλὰ δ’ ἀνθρώποις παρὰ γνώμαν ἔπεσεν. —ἔπεσ' ἔπεσε: for the iteration, cp. 1205 : fr. 686 βΞαρὺς βαρὺς ξύνοικος, ὧ ξένοι, βαρύς. Elsewhere Sophoces usu. iterates a word only after a slight break, as in Ph. 1462 λείπομεν ὑμᾶς, λείπομεν ἤδη (cp. El. 221). 622 A. σύντροφος is strongly recommended by metrical reasons, for the short μέν (= the 1st syll. of κεύθων in 635) is very difficult to defend. Sophocles has, indeed, used the other compound in O. C. 1362 μόχθῳ..ἔντροφον. Here, however, the εν of μὲν might have led to ἔντροφος. Similarly in Ant. 837 ἔγκληρα is probably a corruption of σύγκληρα. For σύντροφος, cp. 61 Ϊ ξύναυλος, n. παλαιᾷ ..ἀμέρᾳ, the day of old age ; cp. Eur. Ion 720 νέαν δ’ ἁμέραν ἀπολιπὼν θάνοι. Ar. Pan. 347 χρονίους ’ ἐτῶν παλαιῶν ἐναυτούς. λευκῷ, the general epithet of γῆρας, seems slightly more poetical here than λευκὰ, though the latter may be supported by Eur. H. F. 909 ὧ λευκὰ γήρ σώματ-. Cp. Bach. 258 γῆρας πολιόν. The use of μὲν and δὲ here is the same as in ‘epanaphora,’ where the ideas represented by the formally opposed clauses are often closely akin ; e.g. Hes. Theog. 656 ἰδμεν ὅ τοι πέρι μὲν πραπίδες πέρι δ’ ἐστὶ νόημα, Her. 7. 9 τῶν ἐπιστάμεθα μὲν τὴν μάχην ἐπιστάμεθα δὲ τὴν δύναμιν. 625 f. νοσοῦντα φρενομόρως, suffering from a calamity (μόρος) to the mind. The adv. (a somewhat strange compound) may have been suggested by the Aeschylean φρενώλης (2heb. 757), φρενομανής (Ag. 1140). It recalls also the paraphrase of μανία in Eur. H. F. 1024 by λυσσάδι .. μοίρᾳ. 627 A. αἴλινον, a loud, wild cry of grief, which for the Greeks had barbaric associations; cp. Eur. Or. 1395 ἴλινον αἴλινον ἀρχὰν θανάτου | βάρβαροι λέγουσιν, αἰαῖ, |’ Ἀσιάδι φωνᾷ κ.τ.λThe mother’s passionate grief wil break forth in a cry of shrill anguish,—not in more subdued and plaintive accents, like those of the nightingale’s lament. The contrast meant here is plain enough; though in some other places, where the bitter grief of the nightingale is the foremost thought, the birds note is sometimes described as ‘ piercing’; e.g. Tr. 963 προὔκλαιον, ὀξύφωνος ὡς ἀηδών (cp. El. 107 tf. .)—ἀηδοῦς in apposition with ὄρνιθος : cp. Eur. H. F. 465 στολήν τε θηρὸς ἀμφέβαλλε σῷ κάρᾳ | λέοντος. For the form, cp. voc. ἀηδοί (Ar. Av. 679), χελιδοῖ (Ar. Av. 1411 etc.), εἰκώ acc. (Eur. Med. 11662 etc..), εἰκούς acc. pl. (2ro. 1178). No nom. ἀηδώ, χελιδώ, or εἰκώ occurs. Conversel οργώ is the regular nom., but the genit. either γοργοῦς (Il. 8. 349) or γοργόνος, and the pl. always γοργόνες. Schol. in L: ἡ ἀηδὼ δὲ κατὰ Μιτυληναίους. 650 ὀξυτόνους El. 243 ὀξυτόννων γόων: Ant. 1316 ὀξυκώκυτον πάθος. 1 T. χερόπλακτοι .. δοῦποι, the sound of beating hands: cp. 55 πολύκερων φόνον (n.): O. C. 1464 κτύπος.. διόβολος. 634 ἄμυγμα, here ‘rending,’ would ordinarily mean ‘a scratch’; cp. Aesch. Ch. 24 πρέπει παρηεῖς φοινίοις ἀμυγμοῖς. The more natural word here would have been σπάραγμα: cp. Eur. Andr. 826 σπάραγμα κόμας ὀνύχων τε δάα̈’ ἀμύγματα θήσομαι: ib. 1209 οὐ σπαράξομαι κόμαν. 65f. κρείσσων.. κεύθων, the personal constr., instead of κρεῖσσόν ἐστι κεύθειν αὐτόν: cp. O. T. κρείσσων γὰρ ἦσθα μηκέτ’ ὢν ἢ ζῶν τυφλός: Lys. or. 26 § 4 κρείττων ἦν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ μὴ λειτουργήσας: Dem.or. 4§ 34 οἴκοι μένων βελτίων: Dionys. Ant. 6. 9 κρείττων γὰρ ἂν.. γένοιτο ὁ τοιοῦτος πολίτης ἀποθανών. Elmsley's emendation, παρ' Ἅιδᾳ, instead of γὰρ Ἄιͅδᾳ (the reading of the mss.), is specious; for Sophocles has that phrase in O. T. 972 and in O. C. 1572; but here he may have been thinking of Il. 23. 24 εἰς ὅ κεν αὐτὸς ἐγὼν Ἄϊδι κεύθωμαι. The personal sense of Hades easily passes into the local; thus we have not only εἰς Ἅιδου (Tr. 4), but εἰς 2̓Αἴδαν (El. 833)). For the simple dat., cp. Ει. 174 οὐρανῷ (n.).—κεύθων, as in O. T. 68 κεύθει κάτω δὴ γῆς. Ant. 911 ἐν Αίδου.. κεκευθότοιν. ὁ νοσῶν μάταν:: here the adv. = ‘foolishly,’ i.e., insanely. Cp. Ar.. Pax 95 τί πέτει; τί μάτην οὐχ ὑγιαίνεις; Aesch. ho. 288 καὶ λύσσα καὶ μάταιος ἐκ νυκτῶν φόβος. For the order of words, instead of ὁ μάταν νοσῶν, cp. El. 792 τοῦ θανοόντος ἀρτίω .ς. 736T. ἐκ πατρῴας ἤκων γενεᾶς ἄριστος ..’ Αχαιῶν, lit., ‘noblest of the Achaeans by his descent (ἥκων) from the line of his fathers’: i.e.., having a prouder lineage than any other Achaean can claim. ἤκων here, going with ἄριστος, has nearly the same force as (e.g.) in O. 1519 θεοῖς ἔχθιστος ἥκω, ‘I have become most hateful to them’: i., it denotes the outcome of an illustrious ancestry. Though ἄριστος (see cc. n.) cannot be regarded as certain, and may be a mere conjecture, it is at least far better than anything else that has been suggested. The ingenious conjecture of Burges, ὃς εὖ πατρῴας ἥκων γενεᾶς ἄνωθεν, would mean, 'fortunate (εὖ ἤκων) ijn his descent (ἄνωθεν) with regard to paternal lineage (the gen. γενεᾶς as in χρημάτων εὖ ἤκοντεν, Her, 5. 67, etc.). But this is tame; and εὖ ἥκων is also prosaic: nor does it acecount for the gen. Ἀχαιῶν. Wecklein, reading εὖ πατρῴας ἥκων γενεᾶς, ἄριστα ..Ἀχαιῶν, understands, ‘fortunate in his lineage,—most so, indeed, of the Achaeans’: so that ἄριστα defines ̀. πολυπόνων refers to warlike toils: cp. Aesch. Pers. 320 πολύπονὸν δόρυ. Her. 9. 27 ἐν τοῖσι Τρωικοῖσι πόνοισι. 630f. συντρόφοις ὀργαῖς, the dissitions that have grown with his growth, is natural τρόποι: for the subst., cp. Ant. 355 ἀστυνόμους ὀργα)ς (n. ; for the adj., Ph. 203 (κτύπος) φωτὸς σύντροφος ὡς τειρομένου του. With ἔμπεδος supply ἐστί: he is not stable, constant, in respect to them (= οὐκ ἐμμένει αὐτῖς..—ἐ ὁμιλεῖ, is conversant (with thoughts) outside of the. ξύντροφοι ὀργαί . The. ondy peculiarity is that from ξυντρόφοις ὀργαῖς we are left to supply ἄλλαις ὀργαῖς (suggested by ἐκτὸς)with ὁμιλεί. (We cannot, surely, understand ἐκτὸς ὁμιλεῖ ξυντρόφοις ὀργαῖς, as if it were an oxymoron, = οὐχ ὁμιλεῖ). The expression is of the same stamp as that in Eur. Bacch. 331 οἴκει μεθ’ ἡμῶν, μὴ θυύραξε τῶν νόμων, ('dwell with us, forsaking not the pale of our customs,’ etc.): ib. 8533 ἔξω δ’ ἐλαύνων τοῦ φρονεῖν. For ὁμιλεῖ, cp. Ar. Rub. 1399 ὡς ἡδὺ καινοῖς πράγμασιν καὶ δξιοῖς ὁμιλεῖν. 641 τλᾶμον. Sophocles has this voc. in Tr. 1112 (ἠῶ τλῆμον Ἑλλάςand in O. C. 978. In the latter place, as here, L has the nom., which may perh. be due to the fact that the nom. τλήμων so often occurs in exclamations ; e.g. 893 : O. C. 18 ὦ τλάμων: Ant. 229: Ph. 1102: Tr. 986. 648 δύσφορον: cp. 31. 644 (. θρεψεν : cp. 503, n. on τρέφει. αἰὼν (if sound) means :lif,.’ not merel as = ‘living man,’ but in the sense o ‘life-destiny’: cp. Tr. 34 τοιοῦτος αἰὼν εἰς δόμους τε κἀκ δόμων | ἀεὶ τὸν ἄνδρ’ ἔπεμπε. The strict meaning would be then, Ano life-destiny which the line of Aeacus has known.’ There is a certain pathos in this which may plead for it as against Reiske’s very plausible emendation δίων (Δ for A), which may be right, though, as compared with αιών, it is perhaps a little weak. Cp. I. 5. 451 δῖοι Ἀχαιοί. 046-002 Second ἐπεισόδιον. Ajax comes forth from the tent, and addresses his faithful friends. The spech translates his unshaken purpose into the terms of his altered mood; yet so as to veil his meaning from the hearers, and to make them think that not only the mood, but the purpose, is changed (See Introduction, § 12.) Tecmessa who left the scene at 595, now returns, entering on the right of the spectators, and leading her child. Their presence adds effect to v. 653 ; and Ajax addresses her at v. 684. 646I. ὁ μακρὸς.. χρόνος: see Her. 5. 9, quoted in n. on 86.— φύει τ’ κ.τ.λ.: the emphasis is on the power of time to enfeeble and destroy, rather than to produce; but the first clause serves to bri the second into relief, and is co-ordinat with it, as in Ant. 1112 ααὐτός τ’ ἔδησα καὶ παρὼν ἐκλύσομαι.The rash change of to φαίνει overlooks the poet's tenency to vary his phrase in such cases ; e.g. O. C. 1501 σαφὴς μὲν ἀστῶν ἐμφαὴς δὲ τοῦ ξένου: O. T. ἄρξεις .κρατεῖς. —κρύπτεται, properly, ‘hides in its own bosom’ (midd..): cp. Aesch. Cho. 127 αῖαν-.. ἢ τὰ πἀντα τίκτεται, ‘produces m herself.’ The midd. of the simple κρύπτω is tece : but cp. 246, and Tt. 474 κρύψομαι (. ... 048 t. ἀελπτον: Archil. fr. 76 χρημάτων ἄελπτον οὐδέν ἐστιν οὐδ’ ἀπώμοτον. Cp. Ant. 388.—ἁλίσκεται, absol., ‘is captured,’ is proved weak’: cp. 1267.— δεινὸς: cp. Tr. 476 ὁ δεινὸς ἵμερος: El. 770 δεινὸν τὸ τίκτειν ἐστίν.—περισκελεῖς : Ant. 475 σίδηρον ὀπτὸν ἐκ πυρὸς περισσκελῆ (n.). Thus the associations of the word lead naturally to his next thought. 650f. τὰ δείν', adv., ‘so wondrously’: cp. 312 n. τότε, lim: cp. 1240: 1377 : Ant. 391: El. 278. σίδηρος ὥς, sc. καρτερὸς γίγνεται, supplied from ἐκαρτέρουν. The βαφή is the cold bath (lacus) into which the hot iron is plunged, and from which it receives the temper of steel. Cp. Od. 9. 391 ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἀνὴρ χαλκεὺς πέλεκυν μέγαν ἡὲ̀ σκέπαρνον | εἰν ὕδατι ψυχρῷ βάπτῃͅ μεγάλα ἰάχοντα| φαρμάσσων· τὸ γὰρ αὖτε σιδήρου γε κράτος ἐστίν: where Eustathius says, στομοῦται σίδηρος τοιαύτῃ βαφῇ καὶ κράτος ἔχει, ὅ ἐστι κρατερὸς γίνεται πυκνούμενος εἰς πλέον. So Galen comares the tonic effect of a cold bath on the uman body with the effeet of the βαφή upon iron (Meth. Med. x. 10, vol. x. 717 uhn), καὶ γὰρ ψυχόμεθα καὶ τονούμεθα, καθάπερ ἐκεῖνος (iron) ἐπειδὰν διάπυρος γενόμενος ἐμβάπτηται τῷ ψυχρῷ. Lucr. 6. 968 umor aquae ferum poro condurat ab ipoi (i.e., ‘after fire’). Hence βαφή the ‘temper’ of steel, and is often used fgurativel.y. Ariet. Pol. 4. (7.) 14§ 22 τὴν γὰρ βαφὴν ἀφιᾶσιν, ὥσπερ ὁ σίδηρος, εἰρήνην ἄγοντες: Plut. Mor. p. 988 D τῆς μὲν ἀνδρείας οἷον βαφή τις ὁ θυμός ἐστι καὶ στόμωμα (‘wrath gives, as it were, a temper and an edge to courage ).This passage has been discussed by R. Paehler, in an essay on ancient steel (185),and by Prof. H. Blümner in his work on Greek and Roman technology (186): see Appendix. ἐθηλύνθην στόμα. The aor. is like ἐπῄνεσα in 536 (n.): i.e., it refers, like οἰκτίρω, to the present, not to the time at which Tecmessa spoke. (Verses 594 f. suffice to prove this.) στόμα, standing so close to βαφῇ σίδηρος ὥς, necessarily sugests the sense of a sharp, hard edge. the same time, itrefers, in its literal sense, to the γλῶσσα τεθηγμένη (584) by which his purpose was announced. Jqot so the father in Aristophanes (Nub. 1107), who wishes his son to be made both acute and fluent, says, μέμνησ’ ὅπως [| εὖ μοι στομώσεις αὐτόν. Hence στόμα cannot be completely translated; and it is the literal sense which should here ce sacrificed to the other. For the verb, cp. Anth. 5. 251. 6 οὔπω ἐθηλύνθης (softened’), οὐδὲ μαραινομένη. 5522. οἰκτίρω ...λιπειῖν natrally sugests the meaning, ‘pity forbids me to eave her’; cp. Od. 20. 202 ὐκ ἐλεαίρεις ἄνδρας.. | μισγέμεναι κακότητι. But the words could also mean, ‘I feel pity at the thought of leaving her,’ implying that he does intend to leave her, though with ain; which would usually be οἰκτίρω εἰ είψω.

So Clytaemnestra’s gifts to Agamemnon's tomb are to be laid up for her with the gods below : κειμήλι' αὐτῇ ταῦτα σῳζέσθω κάτω (El. 438). An ingenious critic, J. Geel, writing on vv 6466—692 in Mnemosyne (II. pp. 200-208, 1853), wishes to omit this verse, because it implies the only direct falsehood in the speech; Ajax was not going to bury his sword under ground. But why should not Ajax think of the sword as destined to be buried in his grave ? The shield alone was excepted from the direction which he gave in 577 : τὰ δ' ἄλλα τεύχη κοί’ ἐμοὶ τεθάψεται.

Suppl. 999, Eum. 203. With Plato τί μήν is frequent in assenting replies, as Phaedr. p. 229 A, ΦΑΙ. ὁρᾷ: οὗν ἐκείην τὴν .. πλάτανον; Σ. τί μήν; Cp. Phileb. p. 17 B and 44 B, Polit. 258 B, etc. The reason for preferring τί μήν to τί μή here is that the former is well attested, whereas there seems to be no certain example of τί μή in the Attic of this period. With τί μή (quidni ?) we should supply ὑπείκωμεν ν; cp. Plat. Theaet. p. 161 X πῶς μὴ φῶμεν ; Dem. or. 21 § 355 ὁ τοιοῦτος πότερα μὴ δῷ διὰ τοῦτο δίκηνν;

has L’s support here, as in El. 506, where see n. The prevalence of αἰανῆς in the texts of this passage may be partly explained by a desire of symnetry, since in v. 673 an epithet is given to ἡμέρᾳ. Both αἰανής and αἰανός were probably classical. Reading αἰαὴς here, we may best take κύκλος with ref. to the course or “round’ of night ; cp. El. 365 πολλαὶ κυκλοῦ͂νται νύκτες..

gnomic aor.., followed by the pres. λύει: cp. El. 26 θυμὸν οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν, | ἀλλ’ ὀρθὸν οὖς ἵστησιν. The ἄημα πνευμάτων is personified as an elemental power (like τὰ δεινὰ etc. in 669). That power can either vex the sea, or give it rest; as Aeolus, the ταμίης ἀνέμων, has the prerogative, ἡμὲν παυέμεαι ἠδ’ ὀρνύμεν, ὅν κ’ ἐθέλῃσι (Od. 10 22). So in 706 Ἀρης is a giver of peace. Cp. Hor. C. 1. 3. 15 (Notus), quo non arbiter Hadriae | Maior, tollere seu poneχ vult fPeta. Vergil may have had Sophocles in mind when he wrote placataque venti | Dant maria (Aen. 3. 69); but when he says, placidi straverunt aequora venti Aen. 5. 763), the epithet makes all the ifference (= ἄνεμοι λήξαντες)). Lobeck, though he refrains from changing δεινῶν to λείων, thinks that the vulgate can be defended only by supposing that the foregoing verbs, ὑπείκει, ἐκχωροῦσιν, ἐξίσταται, tinge ἐκοίμισε with the sense, ‘cease from troubling the sea’: otherwise some addition to ἄημα, such as λῆξαν, would be needed; cp. Pind. I. 7. 12 δεῖμα.. παοιχόμενον| καρτερὰν ἔπαυσε μέριμναν. But this difficulty vaniashes if ἀημα is a personifiecd agency.

The maxim is two-edged. φιλεῖν ὡς μισήσοντα is the side of it which is really in the mind of Ajax:-he dies hating the Greeks whom he had served so nobly (839-844). But the other side—μισεῖν ὡς φιλήσοντα—is that which he wishes his hearers to conceive as foremost in his thoughts. Arist. Rhet. 2. 13 § 4 (old men) κατὰ τὴν Βίαντος ὑποθήκην καὶ φιλοῦσιν ὡς μισή́σοντες καὶ μισοῦσιν ὡς φιλήσοντες. Bias, of Prienè in Ionia, one of the ἐπτὰ σοφοί, is said to have flourished about 50 B.c. For other references to this amous maxim, see Appendix.

..τελεῖσθαι, fullled in all fulness. For the ordinary meaning of διὰ τέλους in Attic prose, see Antiphon or. 5 § 42, where it occurs twice : παρὼν διὰ τέλους ('present all through,’ from first to last): ιὰ τέλους γάρ με ἀπέλυε (‘he acquittted me thoughout,’—in all his statements). So Aesch. P. V. 273 ἀκούσαθ’ ὡς μάθητε διὰ τέλους τὸ πᾶν (i.e. from beginning to end), etc. Here the stress on the notion of end, given by διὰ τέλου τελεῖσθααι, suits the inmost thought of Ajax. The v. l. διὰ τάχους is much feebler.

the gen. θεῶν seems to be possessive rather than artitive ; i.e. the precise sense seems to e, ‘divine dance-maker of the gods, rather than, ‘among the gods, that god who makes dances.’ For such a partitive gen., we nmay, indeed, compare O. C. 868 θεῶν |ὃ πάντα λεύσσων Ἤλιος (unless θεὸς should be read there). But here the meaning seems to be that Pan represents the gods in this function. Pan was to rustic χοροί, those of nymphs and satyrs, what Apollo Μουσαγέτης was to the Olympians ; and the province denoted by χοροποιός here is thus limited by the context. So Pindar fr. 75 calls Pan χορευτὰν τελεώτατον θεῶν: and an Attic σκολιόν greets him as ὀρχηστά, βρομίαις ὀπαδὲ νύμφαις. Νύσια: such dances as the worshippers of Dionysus—with whom Pan is closely associated through the satyrs—hold in his honour at Nysa. As to the various places so called, see on Ant. 1131. Κνώσια: such dances as the Cretan Corybantes hold at Cnosus in honour of Zeus and Apollo. Both the epithets Νύσια and Κνώσια denote a character of wild enthusiasm.—Cnosus, the chief city of Crete, was situated in the north of the island, in one of the plains at the foot of Ida. The form Κνωσός has older and better authority than Κνωσσός. It was there that Daedalus was said to have made the χορός (dancing-place) for Ariadnè (Il. 18. 59o ff.). Crete was the part of Hellas in which an art of ὀρχηστική was first elaborately cultivated ; The hyporcheme itself was originally Cretan (schol. on Pind. P. 2. 127). αὐτοδαῆ is best explained, with the schol. in L, αὐτομαθῆ, ἁ σὺ σαυτὸν ἐδίδαξας. Pan is the inspired and inspiring χοροποιός. The dances will be joyous as those of Nysa or Cnosus, but due to his prompting alone. So the minstrel Phemius says, αὐτοδίδακτος δ’ εἰμί, θεὸς δέ μοι ἐν φρεσὶν οἴμας | παντοίας ἐνέφυσεν, Od. 22. 347. ἰάψως (cp. 501) here denotes properly the act of putting forth the ſeet or the arms in lively movement ; so that lάπτειν ὀρχήματα means strictly, ‘to dance with lively gestures.’ The musician Aristoxenus (c. 300 B.C.) mentioned the Κρητικαὶ ὀρχήσεις among those which he admired διὰ τὴν τῶν χειρῶν κίνησιν (Athen. 1. p. 2B). How ἰάπτω could be associated with swift motion, appears from the intrans. use in Aesch. Suppl. 547 ἰάπτει δ’ Ἀσίδος δι’ αἴας (’rushes’·.—Pan might possibly be said ἰάπτειν ὀρχήματα as ‘impeling’ the dance, i.e., ‘setting it in movement’; but this seems less probable. 701 ΜΜορεῦσαι, aor., because a particular occasion (or act) of dancing is in view : but in O. T. τί δεῖ με χορεύεεν; because the sense is, ‘why should sacred dances continue? 702 f. Ἰκαρίων . . πελαγέων : the island of Icaria, w. of Samos and E. of Myconos, gave its name to the ‘Icarian sea': Il. 2. 145 πόντου Ἰκαρίοιο. Hor. C. 3. 7. 211 scopulis surdior Icari. Ov. Met. 8. 229 (describing how Icarus, son of Daedalus, was drowned) Oraque caerulea, patrium clamantia nomen, | Excipiuntur aqua, quae nomen traxit ab illo. ων : the plur.as in Od. 5. 335 ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσιν. For the synizesits, cp. 718 νεικέων: Fh. 697 ἑλκέων.—For • ὑπὲρ with gen., cp. Ant. 105 Διρκαίων ὑπὲρ ῥεέθρων μολοῦσα. Απόλλων was, like Pan, a lord of the dance; cp. Pind. fr. 148 ὀρχήστ’ ἀγλαίας ἀνάσσων, εὐρυφάρετρ’ Ἀπόλλων: fr. 116 ὁ Μοισαγέτας με καλεῖ χορεῦσαι. Here, however, the words νῦν γὰρ ἐμοὶ μέλει χορεῦσαι seem to close the reference to dancing. Apollo, who in 187 was invoked as ἀποτρόπαιος, is here invited more especiauly as the healer,—to crown, by his bright presence, their joy at the recowery of Ajax.—Fάλιο: cp. O. T. 154 Δάλιε Παιάν (n.). γνωστος, ‘easily recognised,’ i.e., in a visible shape, ἐναρνηή: cp Tt) 11 )d .: Od. 3. 420 (Athena)) ἥ μοι ἐναργὴς ἦλθε. On γνωτός and γνωστός, see O.

Ares, the god of bloodhed and violent death (253 n.), . is said to have *cleared awav’ the cloud of dread trouble which darkened their eyes, because Ajax has renounced his purpose of suicidce. Cp.

For the double epithet, cp. also Ph. 516 εὐστόλου νευ-, 711 λαθίπονος (sc. ἐστί), = λανθάνεται πόνων: the word occurs only here and in Tr. 1021 (λαθίπονον δ’ ὀδυνᾶν). 712 f. πάθυτα θέσμι’ ἐξήνυσ'.
