# Kōdōn

Kōdōn (Greek for the bell of a trumpet or a crier's bell) is a library of components built for displaying and navigating commentaries using CTS URNs.

## Usage

The components are able to be used separately if you wish. You can also just pass all of your edition, translation, and commentary information to the `<ReadingEnvironment>` component for the default display.

The components break down into three columns. The order described below is based on teh default presentation; you can change it by using the columns individually.

### Left column – Navigation

### Center column – Base text (critical edition)

### Right column – Commentary

## Architecture

Relying on CTS URNs allows us to make a few assumptions:

- We can reference every passage in every edition/translation/commentary as long as we can figure out its URN.
- At the work level, we can coordinate comments (_glossae_) across editions. For example, urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003:672@αἰανῆς will not match editions that print αἰανὴς instead. However, we can "climb up" the URN and map a comment with the reference urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003:672@αἰανῆς to line 672 instead. This presentation entails more work for the reader, but it enables glossae to work across editions and translations (as long as a given translation contains alignment information).
- We can (eventually) swap editions, translations, and commentaries _as long as they are aligned_. Swapping makes cross-referencing commentaries that depend on different editions much easier, for example.
