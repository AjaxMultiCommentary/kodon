# Kōdōn (κώδων)

> φώνημ᾽ ἀκούω καὶ ξυναρπάζω φρενὶ
> χαλκοστόμου κώδωνος ὡς Τυρσηνικῆς.

> I hear your voice and grasp it in my mind, / like the voice of a bronze-belled Tyrrhenian trumpet. – Sophocles, _Ajax_ ll. 16–17

Part of the [Ajax Multi-Commentary](https://github.com/AjaxMultiCommentary/) project, Kōdōn (Greek for the "bell of a trumpet") is a minimal computing platform for authoring and compiling (multi-)commentaries.

## What is a multi-commentary?

A multi-commentary pulls glossae from more than one commentary at once, applying these comments to lemmata in a shared edition of the text. (In future iterations, a multi-commentary might also entail multiple editions of a text.)

By creating a shared edition for all of the comments to cite simultaneously, a multi-commentary enables the reader to explore hundreds of years of a commentary tradition at a glance, gleaning new insights into how the commentaries interact with the critical text and with each other.

## How does it work?

The multi-commentary platform works by combining editions, commentaries, and (optionally) translations into a reading environment.

### Editions

Editions are [TEI XML](https://tei-c.org). Kōdōn will parse properly formatted TEI for canonical references using the `<refsDecl>` element in the TEI header. For now, because Kōdōn focuses on amplifying commentaries, each canonical reference mainly consists of its CTS URN citation — e.g., for line 17 of Sophocles' _Ajax_ `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003.perseus-grc2:17` — and the plain text reference to the line.

There is, however, rudimentary support for handling TEI's `<del>` and `<add>` elements, with plans to support additional markup in the future.

### Commentaries

Each commentary consists of a series of glosses that point to canonical references in the editions. Citations to critical editions must be formatted as CTS URNs. For example, to cite the word κώδωνος at Sophocles, _Ajax_ l. 17, you would use the following URN: `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003.perseus-grc2:17@κώδωνος`.

**TODO**: Should we continue to support the slide-based short syntax for per-comment metadata, relying on the YAML block only document-level data? Or should we use a YAML metadata block for each glossa and treat each glossa as a separate markdown document?

### Translations

Like commentaries, translations must point to a critical edition of the text.

**TODO**: Specify how translations should work.

## Bibliographies

An essential component of any commentary is its bibliography. Kōdōn supports bibliographies in the JSON format exported by Zotero, with future support planned for BibLaTeX.

To cite an item in a glossa, use the `\@citekey` syntax, replacing "citekey" with the cite key of the item you wish to cite.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte library, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

Read more about creating a library [in the docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```
